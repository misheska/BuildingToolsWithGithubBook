== Search

=== What can it do?

Once you have enough data, it's not enough to simply organize it.
You need first-class search capability if you want to have any hope of finding anything at all.
GitHub's search API gives you access to the full power of the built-in search function, and using operators, it provides access to a very powerful way of finding the thing you're looking for.

==== General Principles

The search API can be used over raw HTTP.
The central anchor point is `https://api.github.com/v3/search`, or if you're searching an Enterprise instance, `https://<server>/api/v3/search`.
You can search anonymously without authenticating as a GitHub user, but your results will be limited to public items – which means this won't work with an Enterprise install.
Authentication is a bit of a complicated topic, but the library we use later on abstracts it for us, so we'll gloss over it for now, and rely on public results to get a feel for what comes back.

===== Rate Limits

Calls to these APIs are subject to rate limits, which are stricter than other APIs because search is computationally expensive.
As of this writing, the documentation states that anonymous searches are limited to 5 per minute, where authenticated queries are limited at 20 per minute.
Whatever the limit is when you're reading this, you can find out the status of your rate limit by checking the `X-RateLimit-*` headers that come with your response.
They look like this:

[source,console]
----
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 9
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1430621780
----

The `Limit` header shows what your cap is, while the `Remaining` header tells you how many queries you have left.
The `Reset` header is a tells you when the counter will reset, in UTC epoch seconds.

===== Pagination

The JSON returned from most calls will have this general format:

[source,json]
----
{
  "total_count": 824,
  "incomplete_results": false,
  "items": [ … ]
}
----

The `total_count` field represents the total number of search results that turned up from this query; by default, only the first 30 are returned.
You can customize this with `page` and `per_page` query parameters in the url.
For example, a GET request to `search/repositories?q=foobar&page=2&page_size=100` will return 200 items, starting with the 101st result.
Page sizes are generally limited to 100.

The `incomplete_results` field refers to a computation limit placed on search results.
If your search takes too long, the GitHub API will stop it partway through executing, return the results that did complete, and set this flag to `true`.
For most queries this won't be a problem, and the `total_count` will represent all the results from the search, but if your query is complicated, you might only get a partial result set.

===== Sorting

Search results are returned in a non-arbitrary order.
The default order is "best match," with the best of the best returned first.
If you want to override this, you can pass `stars`, `forks`, or `updated` in the `sort` query parameter.

You can also reverse the sort order using the `order` parameter.
The default is `desc`, but `asc` is also accepted.


===== Search Operators

Your search term is passed through the `q` parameter, but that term has a powerful syntax.
You can specify many operators, including these:

- `user:<name>`, where _name_ is a user or organization
- `repo:<name>`
- `language:<name>`
- `created:<date(s)>`
- `extension:<pattern>` matches file extensions (like "py")

Note that numerical matches and dates can have ranges:

- `2015-02-01` will match only the given date
- `<2015-02-01` will match any date previous to the one given
- `2015-02-01..2015-03-01` will match dates within the given range, including the end points

There are many other options besides.
Check out https://github.com/search/advanced[] for a UI that can help you construct a query.


==== Search APIs

The search API is compartmentalized into four categories: repositories, code, issues, and users.
The basic mechanism is the same for all four: provide a URL-encoded search term as the `q` parameter to a GET request.

===== Repository Search

The `search/repositories` endpoint responds with something that looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "total_count": 824,
  "incomplete_results": false,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 10869370,
      "name": "foobar",
      "full_name": "iwhitcomb/foobar",
      "owner": {
        "login": "iwhitcomb",
        "id": 887528,
        "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/887528?v=3",
        …
      },
      …
    },
    …
  ]
}
----

What comes back is a list of items, each of which looks like the result of a query to the Repositories API.
Each item in `items` is a representation of a repository, with all sorts of useful information about that repository and its owner.

===== Code Search

The `search/code` endpoint has a couple of limitations, stemming from the sheer amount of data available.
It requires that you scope it to a user or organization, using the `user:<name>` search operator.
Also, it only searches the default branch of any given project, which is usually `master`.

The JSON returned looks something like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "total_count": 9246,
  "incomplete_results": false,
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "migrated_0000.js",
      "path": "test/fixtures/ES6/class/migrated_0000.js",
      "sha": "37bdd2221a71b58576da9d3c2dc0ef0998263652",
      "url": "…",
      "git_url": "…",
      "html_url": "…",
      "repository": {
        "id": 2833537,
        "name": "esprima",
        "full_name": "jquery/esprima",
        "owner": {
          "login": "jquery",
          "id": 70142,
          "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70142?v=3",
          …
        },
        "private": false,
        …
      },
      "score": 2.3529532
    },
    …
  ]
}
----

Each item has some data about the file that turned up, including its name and URLs for a couple of representations of it.
Then there's the blob of data about its repository, followed by a score, which is used for the default "best match" sorting.

===== Issue Search

[source,json]
----
{
  "total_count": 1278397,
  "incomplete_results": false,
  "items": [
    {
      "url": "…",
      "labels_url": "…",
      "comments_url": "…",
      "events_url": "…",
      "html_url": "…",
      "id": 69671218,
      "number": 1,
      "title": "Classes",
      "user": {
        "login": "reubeningber",
        "id": 2552792,
        "avatar_url": "…",
        …
      },
      "labels": [
        …
      ],
      "state": "open",
      "locked": false,
      "assignee": null,
      "milestone": null,
      "comments": 0,
      "created_at": "2015-04-20T20:18:56Z",
      "updated_at": "2015-04-20T20:18:56Z",
      "closed_at": null,
      "body": "There should be an option to add classes to the ul and li being generated. ",
      "score": 22.575937
    },
  ]
}
----


===== User Search

Querying the `search/users` endpoint gives you this kind of response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "total_count": 26873,
  "incomplete_results": false,
  "items": [
    {
      "login": "ben",
      "id": 39902,
      "avatar_url": "…",
      "gravatar_id": "",
      "url": "…",
      "html_url": "…",
      …
      "score": 98.24275
    },
    {
      "login": "bengottlieb",
      "id": 53162,
      "avatar_url": "…",
      "gravatar_id": "",
      "url": "…",
      "html_url": "…",
      …
      "score": 35.834213
    },
  ]
}
----

The list of items in this case look like the results from a query of `users/<name>`, and contain lots of bits of data about each user, as well as a search ranking score.

===== More API Details

This chapter only scratches the surface of what's possible using the search API.
GitHub provides live and complete documentation of these methods at https://developer.github.com/v3/search/[], and we encourage you to look there if you want to dig deeper.


=== Our example application

Let's do something useful with this API.
Imagine your development team uses GitHub to store their Git repositories, and that there are lots of little repositories for parts of the application that work together at runtime.
This kind of situation ends up being fairly difficult to work with for your non-technical colleagues; if they want to report an issue, they don't know where to go, and they don't know how to find issues that already exist.

Search can make this possible, but doing a search across an entire organization's repositories involves using the `user:<organization>` operator, which is obtusely named, and kind of scary for non-programmers.

The Search API can make this a bit easier.
Let's make a GUI application with just a single search box, which makes it dead simple for a non-technical user to search all the issues in all the repositories in a single organization.
It'll end up looking a bit like this:

image::images/python-search.png[]

==== User flow

Since the Search API is throttled pretty aggressively, and also because we want the ability to search private repositories' issues, we'll need the user to log in.
Our program will try to get GitHub credentials from Git's credential store, but it'll fall back to a login form, which looks like this:

image::images/python-login.png[]

Once the user logs in, they'll be shown a search box.
Typing in a search query and hitting enter results in a scrollable list of search results, with titles and the first line of the description.
Clicking on a search result opens the issue in the user's browser.

That's it!
It's a simple, focused tool to solve a very tightly-defined problem, so the code shouldn't be too hard.

=== Python

We'll use Python for our implementation language, for several reasons.
First, because we haven't yet seen it in this book.
One of our goals is to help the reader explore technologies they might not have seen before.

Secondly, there's a library which includes facilities for building a GUI application which will run on OS X, Linux, and Windows.
This is fairly unique feature among modern high-level programming languages.
If you want this capability elsewhere, you usually have to use a high-complexity framework or a lower-level language like C++.

Thirdly, this will make it easy to distribute.
There exists a Python package which bundles an entire Python program and all of its dependencies into a single file (or `.app` bundle on OS X).
So giving this program to a colleague is as easy as emailing her a ZIP file.

==== Development libraries

In order to follow along with the development of this application, you'll need to install a few Python packages.
