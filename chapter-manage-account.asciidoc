==== Follow Statistics and Stars

This area advertises how many developers someone is following as well as
how many are following them.    

This section also shows others the list of repositories a user has starred.

==== Tracking Platform

This is the social aspect of Github that makes this platform very
diferent from every other open source community that has came before
it.   The ability to keep track of interesting developers and find out
what they are working on gives you the ability to follow particularly
innovative people and find particularly innovative projects.

For example, you can keep track of Linus Torvald's activity on the
Linux Kernal while, at the same time, keeping track of the what the
core Rails team is paying attention to.

There are some interesting nuances in Github when it comes to email
addresses and notifications.    If you have to maintain multiple
email addresses, say for work and then for personal OSS contributions,
Github gives you the option to do this and then to route specific
emails to specific accounts.  This section outlines how...

refer to the User Account Settings (xref).

contributors, Github is going to require a subscription plan.   To
open your billing preferences, click...
