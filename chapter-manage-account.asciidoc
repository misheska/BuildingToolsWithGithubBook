== Profiles and Account Management

In Github there are two types of accounts: individual and
organization.  Most GitHub users will only ever have an individual
account this is the account you created when you signed up for GitHub,
selected a username and a password, and it is associated with a
profile which is your identity in GitHub.  This chapter covers the
management of this profile and the various options that are available
for individual accounts.

=== Viewing a User Profile

Viewing anyone's profile is easy, just append a user's username to the
GitHub URL.  For example, to laod the profile page for Linux Torvalds
go to http://www.github.com/torvalds.  The creator of the Linux Kernel
will be staring back at you alongside his popular repositories,
location, most used languages, organization, number of followers, and developer
contribution activity.  You can learn quite a bit about a developer
from a GitHub profile, and the public profile has been designed to
feature a user's open source contributions.

The amount of information displayed on a user profile changes depending
on the relationship you have with another user and depending on what
he or she is sharing with you.  For example, if you load your own
GitHub profile, you'll see everything including private repositories
and a list of contributions that spans both public and private
repositories.  The information displayed on a user's profile changes
depending on the level of access a user has to information about a
user.  For example, if you are a member of an Organization's team
which grants access to a collection of private repositories, you will
be able to view another user's contributions to this library on the
GitHub user profile page.

==== Follow Statistics and Stars

This area advertises how many developers someone is following as well as
how many are following them.    

This section also shows others the list of repositories a user has starred.

==== Tracking Platform

This is the social aspect of Github that makes this platform very
diferent from every other open source community that has came before
it.   The ability to keep track of interesting developers and find out
what they are working on gives you the ability to follow particularly
innovative people and find particularly innovative projects.

For example, you can keep track of Linus Torvald's activity on the
Linux Kernel while, at the same time, keeping track of the what the
core Rails team is paying attention to.

.Leaking Information, GitHub-style
[NOTE]
If you use GitHub for a combination of both open source and
proprietary development, you should take time every few weeks to make
sure that your public profile isn't leaking proprietary information or
information that was never mean to be shared. Shortly after GitHub
released its powerful Search API in 2013, there was a controversy when
people started searching for private SSH keys (files which are never
meant to be shared with anyone). Many users were versioning a home
directory and inadvertenty sharing very private information in a
public repository. When using a platform that straddles both the
private and the public, you'll want to make sure that you take some
time to view your own profiles and repositories as an unauthenticated,
anonymous user.


=== Editing a User Profile

==== Creating a Profile Picture with Gravatar

Your image on Github, it is a Gravatar.   Don't be scared, go get one.

==== Managing Your Organizational Associations

Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

==== To Advertise or Not to Advertise Organization Membership

Just because you are associated with an organization, it doesn't mean
that everyone needs to know about it.

=== Changing Account Settings

==== Choosing a Good Password

About password security

==== Changing Your Username

Do you really want to do this?   Think twice, this has side-effects.

=== Email and Notifications

There are some interesting nuances in Github when it comes to email
addresses and notifications.    If you have to maintain multiple
email addresses, say for work and then for personal OSS contributions,
Github gives you the option to do this and then to route specific
emails to specific accounts.  This section outlines how...

==== Working with Multiple Email Addresses

==== What is a "Verified" email?

If you don't verify your email...

==== Custom Email Routing for Organizations

If you are like me you have several email addresses...

=== Account Security

==== Your SSH Keys

Maybe a brief discussion of what an SSH Key is for those who don't yet know.

===== How to create an SSH Key

Easy instructions, assume linux(-ish) instructions.

Provide a pointer for Windows users.

===== Do your SSH Keys have a Password? (ssh-agent)

Briefly discuss the pros and cons of passwordless SSH keys.

==== When should I use SSH vs HTTPS?

Always, do it.

===== Alternative: Official Github Client

Remember that if you have to support non-technical users, the official
Github client is a great option.

==== Security History

==== Applications

===== What is OAuth?

===== Authorized Applications

Be careful who you trust.

=== Your Repositories

==== Creating a New Repository

How to create a new repository.

==== How to Decide: Private vs Public

Github is a great way to unintentionally make a bunch of code public
by mistake.

==== Leaving a Repository

If you need to leave, here's the exit.

=== Deleting Your Account

Now why would you want to go and do a thing like that?   If you do,
refer to the User Account Settings (xref).

=== Github Billing Preferences

If you are going to have private repositories with private
contributors, Github is going to require a subscription plan.   To
open your billing preferences, click...

==== Payment History and Invoices

If you need to obtain an invoice for your Github account (maybe
because you need to convince your boss to pay for a Github account?).
There is a helpful list of invoices.
