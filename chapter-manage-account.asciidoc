== Profiles and Account Management

In Github there are two types of accounts: individual and
organization.  Most GitHub users will only ever have an individual
account this is the account you created when you signed up for GitHub,
selected a username and a password, and it is associated with a
profile which is your identity in GitHub.  This chapter covers the
management of this profile and the various options that are available
for individual accounts.

=== Viewing a User Profile

Viewing anyone's profile is easy, just append a user's username to the
GitHub URL.  For example, to laod the profile page for Linux Torvalds
go to http://www.github.com/torvalds.  The creator of the Linux Kernel
will be staring back at you alongside his popular repositories,
location, most used languages, organization, number of followers, and developer
contribution activity.  You can learn quite a bit about a developer
from a GitHub profile, and the public profile has been designed to
feature a user's open source contributions.

image::images/user-profile.png[]

The amount of information displayed on a user profile changes depending
on the relationship you have with another user and depending on what
he or she is sharing with you.  For example, if you load your own
GitHub profile, you'll see everything including private repositories
and a list of contributions that spans both public and private
repositories.  The information displayed on a user's profile changes
depending on the level of access a user has to information about a
user.  For example, if you are a member of an Organization's team
which grants access to a collection of private repositories, you will
be able to view another user's contributions to this library on the
GitHub user profile page.

==== Follow Statistics and Stars

This area advertises how many developers someone is following as well as
how many are following them.  It also lists the repositories a
particular user has starred.

Followers::

    Clicking on followers will show you a list of the users who have
    decided to follow this user.

Starred::

   Click on "starred" will display a list of repositories this use r
   has "starred".  What is the significance of a star? The definition
   is really up to you.  Some users may think they are providing a personal
   endorsement to a particular repository while others may hand out
   stars for anything they are interested in.  Think of staring as a
   repository as you would a Facebook "like" or a Google+ "+1".

Following::

   Click on following will show you which users this user is
   interested in enough to follow.

[NOTE] 
Now statistics like "How many followers" does so-and-so have
and "How many are they following" always remind me of middle school,
but there is some value to the metric.  Just look at systems like
Stack Overflow which have succeeded at turning expertise into a
measurable statistic. Clearly you can get carried away in a world that
is constantly focused on how many Facebook, Twitter, GitHub followers
you have, but when you are looking at someone's collected body of work
on GitHub it helps to also understand that they have attracted a large following.

==== Tracking Platform

This is the social aspect of Github that makes this platform very
diferent from every other open source community that has came before
it.   The ability to keep track of interesting developers and find out
what they are working on gives you the ability to follow particularly
innovative people and find particularly innovative projects.

image::images/user-public-activity.png[]

For example, you can keep track of Linus Torvald's activity on the
Linux Kernel while, at the same time, keeping track of the what the
core Rails team is paying attention to.   Not only can you track how
many followers a particular user or project has amassed, you can also
drill into the list of followers.  On GitHub there is no ability to
follow a user privately. When you follow or star a project, you do so
publicly.

This ability to measure different kinds of activity and interest in
repositories means that you can start to learn from the wisdom of
GitHub's crowd. In an industry that can change on a dime this ability
to see what the crowd is watching helps you identify trending
languages and libraries in a way that is empircal.  You don't have to
rely on seeing an article published by a company in an
advertising-driven web site to understand that there is a huge number
of projects and people paying attention to Twitter Bootstrap.  No, the
number of forks and the fact that it is the most forked project on
GitHub are all the proof you need that something about that project is
worth paying attention ti.

.Leaking Information, GitHub-style
[NOTE]
A word of caution: If you use GitHub for a combination of both open
source and proprietary development, you should take time every few
weeks to make sure that your public profile isn't leaking proprietary
information or information that was never mean to be shared. Shortly
after GitHub released its powerful Search API in 2013, there was a
controversy when people started searching for private SSH keys (files
which are never meant to be shared with anyone). Many users were
versioning a home directory and inadvertantly sharing very private
information in a public repository. When using a platform that
straddles both the private and the public, you'll want to make sure
that you take some time to view your own profiles and repositories as
an unauthenticated, anonymous user.


=== Editing Your User Profile

To edit your profile, click on your username in the upper right-hand
corner of the GitHub interface.  This will show you your own profile,
at this point click on the "Edit Your Profile" button and you will see
a form resembling the one shown below.

image::images/user-edit-profile.png[]

The Public Profile form contains the following fields, many of which
are self-explanatory.

Name::
    Your name if you have one.  (An important thing to know is that
    you've agreed to supply your full name as a part of the GitHub
    terms of service.)

Email::
    GitHub allows you to specify any number of email addresses.  If
    you are a member of several organizations in GitHub, you will
    frequently have various email addresses associated with a single
    GitHub account.  This field on the Public Profile page is for the
    email address which will be listed as your one, public emails
    address.

URL::
    This is a URL that will be associated with your account. Often
    users will list a personal blog or a company website.

Company::
    If you choose to associate your GitHub account with a company, you
    can list it here.  Not that you may also be a member of one or
    more GitHub organization teams.  Your members on these teams
    doesn't have to line up with the Company listed on your profile.

Location::
    Should you choose to share it, you can supply a Location to
    GitHub.  Most people either list a country, a city, a state, or a
    combination thereof.

==== Creating a Profile Picture with Gravatar

Maybe you've updated the Gravatar Email and noticed that your profile
picture is already populated.  Maybe you haven't.  If you understand
what Gravatar is, you'll understand why your profile picture is
already populated.  If you don't know what Gravatar is, read on.

Your image on Github, it is from Gravatar.   Gravatar is a just that a
Globally Recognized Avatar.  An iconic picture which is associated
with your email address.  Gravatar (http://www.gravatar.com) is a
service from The Automattic Team - the team behind Wordpress, Akismet,
IntenseDebate, and a number of other popular services.

To upload a new avatar associated with your email address follow these
steps:

. Go to Gravatar in a browser at http://www.gravatar.com

. Type in your email in the text-field shown on Gravatar's site

. Click on "Get Your Gravatar" and follow the instructions

At this point, you will be able to upload one or more images to your
Gravatar account and assign a content rating to your newly uploaded
avatar.  This image will follow you around the web whenever you use
services that are integrated with Gravatar including GitHub,
WordPress, Hootsuite, and StackOverflow.  If you don't have one, go
get one. People want to know what you look like.

Gravatar Email::
    This field is available on your GitHub profile and it is the email
    address GitHub uses to retrieve your avatar from Gravatar.  Note
    that the contents of this field are not shared on your public
    profile.  If you want to list a public email on your GitHub
    profile that is different from your Gravatar email address, go
    right ahead.

==== Managing Your Organizational Associations

While you are editing your profile, take a look at the left-hand menu
and you will see a link for Organizations.  While the Profile option is
the first item in this menu, the Organizations item is the last option
in this menu. Click on this menu item and you will see a list of
organizations that list you as a member.

When you maintain an organization you have the power to add any GitHub
user to a team, and teams are used to group people and assign
privileges to specific repositories. Organization administrators have
the ability to associate you with any organization, but what if you
want to leave an organization?   That's where this interface comes
into play.  This organizations page exists for you to see a list of
the organizations that include you on a team and allow you to leave an
organization.

Maybe you are a consultant that works for many clients and your time
with a particular time has come to an end?  Maybe you are a consultant
trying to send a message to a client that has decided not to pay your
bill on time?  Maybe you are looking for a creative way to quit your
current job?  If you want to leave an organization, click the Leave
button and enjoy, and don't let the door hit you on the way out.

image::images/user-orgs.png[]

[NOTE]
Leaving an organization is a dramatic thing.  When you leave an
organization, GitHub is going to remove from all Organization teams
and you'll be unable to see any private activity within that
organization.  Don't play with this button and don't leave an
organization unless you know what you are doing. One wonders why this
button isn't in the Danger Zone?

==== Advertising Organization Membership

Your association with an organization is two-way street.  Just because
an organization has included you on a team, this doesn't mean that
your associate with this organization is going to appear on your
public profile. For this to happen, one of two things will have to
happen:

. One of the Owners of the Organization will need to publicize your
membership in the organization.

. You will need to publicize your membership in an organization.

To publicize your membership in an organization, go to the members
page of this organization.  For example, I'm a member of the Tomitribe
organization, to publicize my membership I would go to
https://github.com/tomitribe?tab=members and then click on Publicize
Membership.

image::images/user-publicize.png[]

Once I clicked on that button, an event would be added to my timeline,
and the Tomitribe membership would then be listed on my public
profile.  If I changed my mine and wanted to conceal my membership in
the Tomitribe organization I would return to the same page:
https://github.com/tomitribe?tab=members - and I would then click on
the Conceal Membership button.

.To Advertise or Not to Advertise Organization Membership
[NOTE]
Just because you are associated with an organization, it doesn't mean
that everyone needs to know about it. If you are working for an open
source company - a company that supports open source development via
commercial support - it makes perfect sense to advertise your
association with an organization.  If you are associated with an open
source foundation, it makes perfect sense to advertise that. On the
other hand, if you are a member of an organization that is doing work
for the CIA, you may not wish to advertise that association.  GitHub
built in the ability to publicize or conceal membership in
organizations because it respects the idea that everyone should be
able to exert some control of the public interface they provide to the world.

=== Changing Account Settings

In the previous section you learned how to change the information in
your profile, in this section you'll learn how to change your account
settings, your password, and your username.

To edit your account settings, click on the tool icon in the upper
right-hand of the GitHub interface.  This will load the Edit Profile
page.  In left-hand navigation menu, click on Account Settings.  Now
the Account Settings form is a bit of a dangerous place, here you can
change your password, your username, or, if you really want to, delete
your account.

image::images/user-account-settings.png[]

To change your password, you'll need to supply your current password
once and your new password twice for confirmation.  Once you've
supplied your new password twice, click on Update Password to change
your password.  This section of the form also provides a password
recovery link - if you need to recovery your password, click on the "I
forgot my password" link next to the Update Password button.

.Choose a Good Password
[NOTE]
GitHub isn't picky about passwords, and it is up to you to choose a
good password.  GitHub's minimum standards are seven characters with
at least one number. Don't let GitHub's reliance on SSH keys convince
you that it is security, if someone were to gain access to your GitHub
password they could exact some real damage. Choose a strong password.


==== Changing Your Username

Do you really want to do this?  No, really? You change your name on
GitHub and everyone who knows you as "razzmatazz" is going to have to
learn to call you "b1gdawg". Everyone who has grown used to seeing
your commits is going to have to learn to recognize under this new use
name.  Really, even if you think things are going to be better after
your magical username change, please understand that this is going to
change your interface to the public.  Think twice, this has some real
side-effects.

=== Email and Notifications

There are some interesting nuances in Github when it comes to email
addresses and notifications.    If you have to maintain multiple
email addresses, say for work and then for personal OSS contributions,
Github gives you the option to do this and then to route specific
emails to specific accounts. 

==== Working with Multiple Email Addresses

It isn't uncommon for people to have multiple addresses for a number
of reasons.  Consultants who work on long-term projects often get an
email address under a client's domain, developers who contribute to
open source projects often have an email address specific to a
foundation such as Apache or Eclipse, and almost everyone has at least
two email addresses - a personal email address and a work email
address.

GitHub is smart enough to understand that your GitHub identity, you
profile, needs to be flexible enough to allow for multiple email
addresses.  GitHub also needs to make sure that your identity, your
email address remains consistent when you are contributing to
different projects in different organizations. For example, if you are
working on a personal, hobby project you need to able to tell GitHub
to use your personal address.  On the other hand, if you are
contributing to a project via an organization that you work for,
you'll want GitHub to send notifications to your work email.

To manage your email address, go to your Account Settings then click
on Emails.   On this screen you will see a list of all email address
associated with your account and a green "Primary" badge next to the
email that is to be used as your primary email address.

image::images/user-email-addresses.png[]

When you add a new email address to your GitHub account you will be
asked to verify that email address.   GitHub will send you an email
with a confirmation, once you verify an email address it can be used
in GitHub as a primary or as an email to route organization activity to.


.Keeping Your Email Private
[NOTE]
Some people don't want the whole world to know an email address.  If
you are want to keep prying eyes away from your email address. Check
the "Keep my email address private". When GitHub sends out an email on
your behalf it will use a bogus email address instead of your real
email address.


==== Managing Notifications

Depending on how popular you are with the developers, GitHub can be a
very chatty source of email.  Every time someone mentions you in a
comment or a commit with an @ sign in front of your GitHub username
GitHub's default configuration will send you a notification email and
also notify you via the browser. If people are constantly mentioning
you, you may want to disable this notification preference.

You are also sent and email and a web notification anytime a
repository you are watching changes.  If you are watching a lot of
repositories, this steady stream of email notifications can quickly
grow to be unmangeable and overwhelming.   To manage your notification
preferences, go to Account Settings and then click on Nofitication
Center in the left-hand navigation menu.

image::images/user-notifications.png[]

From this interface, you can configure GitHub not to send
notifications of these events.  You can also configure GitHub not to
send a browser alert in the event of a notification.

==== Custom Email Routing for Organizations

When you are associated with many organizations and when you have
multiple emails that correspond to these organizations it makes good
sense to route organization-specific notifications to your verified
organization email address.  For example, if you have a personal email
address for your own projects and a work email for your work
organization's project you can configure GitHub to send any
notifications dealing with your work organization to your work email
address.

In the Nofication Center shown in the previous section there is a
space for custom routing rules.  A custom routing rule associates all
notifications that original from an organization's repositories with a
specific email.

=== Account Security

There are two ways to use Git with GitHub, you can use the HTTP
protocol to clone and push to repositories, or you can use git over
SSH.  When you use HTTP, you are asked to supply a username and
password with your request, and for many non-technical users, this is
the best approach to GitHub security. 

For more technical users of Git and GitHub, ssh keys provide the
safest approach to authorization against a GitHub hosted repository.

==== Your SSH Keys

Maybe a brief discussion of what an SSH Key is for those who don't yet know.

image::images/user-ssh.png[]

===== How to create an SSH Key

If you have ssh installed on a unix-variant such as OSX or Linux, the
command to generate a new SSH key is:

----
$ sss-keygen -t rsa
----

Easy instructions, assume linux(-ish) instructions.

Provide a pointer for Windows users.

===== Do your SSH Keys have a Password? (ssh-agent)

Briefly discuss the pros and cons of passwordless SSH keys.

==== When should I use SSH vs HTTPS?

Always, do it.

===== Alternative: Official Github Client

Remember that if you have to support non-technical users, the official
Github client is a great option.

==== Security History

==== Applications

image::images/user-applications.png[]

===== What is OAuth?

image::images/user-applications-register.png[]

===== Authorized Applications

Be careful who you trust.

=== Your Repositories

One important aspect of managing your GitHub account is managing the
repositories you call your own.  In GitHub your repository are
comprised of the repositories you have created alongside the
repositories you have forked into your own account.  In addition,
GitHub will also show you the private individual repositories which
others have shared with you.

==== Leaving a Repository

If another user with an individual plan creates a repository and lists
you as a collaborator there may be times when you want to leave that
repository. This action has the effect of removing you from the list
of collaborators on a repository.  To leave a repository, open your
Account Settings, and then click on Repositories in the left-hand
navigation menu.

image::images/user-leave-repo.png[]

This list contains all of your repositories, both public and private,
as well as individual repositories other have added you to.  To leave
a repository, click on the Leave button.  This will remove you as a
collaborator for that repository.

=== Deleting Your Account

Now why would you want to go and do a thing like that?   Maybe you set
up two accounts for yourself and you want to merge them into a single
account and delete the old one? Maybe you woke up today and realized that
you wanted nothing to do with software development, version control,
or GitHub? Maybe you've gone mad and you think GitHub is a part of a
global conspiracy to keep track of your every move? Whatever your
reasons, know that GitHub has a delete account button waiting for you
in the your Account Settings.

To delete your account, load your account settings, and then click on
Account Settings in the left-hand navigation menu.  Once you do this,
you'll see a red section that should remind you of The Danger Zone. To
delete your account click on "Delete your account".

image::images/user-delete-account.png[]

But, wait!  Not to fast, take your mouse off of that button, and don't
do anything brash.  Don't make a decision in anger. Understand that
you are about to do something that cannot be undone. If you have
repositories, they will be lost. All of those people following you on
GitHub, they will have one less person to follow. Every issue with
your name on it will point to an empty user no longer using
GitHub. Maybe you should take a day and think about this
decision.

=== Github Billing Preferences

GitHub has an interesting business model.  You can use the system to
create as many public repositories as you wish with no limits, but if
you want private repositories with private contributors, Github is
going to require a subscription plan.

To open your billing preferences, click on the acount settings icon in
the upper right-hand side of the GitHub interface.  This is the icon
with a wrench and a screwdriver.  Once you can see account settings,
click on Billing in the left-hand navigation menu.

image::images/user-billing.png[]

From this screen you can upgrade or downgrade to a different plan and
you can update your credit card information.  You can redeem a coupon,
and you can also supply any additional contact information you need to
list on your receipts.

Plans range from Free which allows for no private repositories to
Large which allows for 50 private repositories.  If your requirements
exceed 50 private repositories you can request a higher limit, but at
that point you should really consider upgrading to an Organization.
Managing 20+ private repositories with multiple contributors isn't
easy without the benefit of Organization teams.

==== Payment History and Invoices

If you need to obtain an invoice for your Github account.  Open open
your account settings and click on Payment History.  From this screen
you can download receipts and see just how much your GitHub habit is
costing you.
