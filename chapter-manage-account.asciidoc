==== Follow Statistics and Stars

This area advertises how many developers someone is following as well as

==== Github is a Genius Tracking Platform

This is the social aspect of Github that makes this platform very
diferent from every other open source community that has came before

what they are working on gives you the ability to follow particularly
innovative people and find particularly innovative projects.
