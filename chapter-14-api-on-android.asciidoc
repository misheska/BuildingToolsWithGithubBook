== GitHub API on Android

Android is currently the most popular operating system for mobile
devices, overtaking Symbian OS in 2010, experiencing incredible growth
since its release in 2008. Many software developers would not consider
a mobile device as a worthwhile platform for software developer tool
creation, but as more and more people shift to using mobile devices,
we will see demand for tools on mobile devices. The GitHub API has a
good set of bindings for developing Java and Android applications.
We'll use the egit libraries to develop a small Android application
which posts to our blog hosted on GitHub.

We will build an application which uses one of the unique features of a
mobile device: GPS. Our blogging application will allow us to login to
GitHub, determine our location, and then ask us for a quick note
describing what we are doing. The application will then compose a
Jekyll blog post for us and push the post into our blog on GitHub.

=== Prerequisites

If you don't have a physical Android device, don't fret. You can follow
along with this chapter without having an actual Android device by doing
development from a virtual device. 

==== Installing the Java SDK

Unfortunately there is no simple shell command to install Java in the
same way as there is for Ruby and NodeJS using RVM or NVM. 
Oracle controls the Java language and distribution of official SDKs,
and they restrict access to downloads other than from java.oracle.com.
Java is freely available, but you need to visit java.oracle.com and
find the correct download for your needs. Android works with either
the 1.6 or 1.7 versions of Java.

==== Installing the Android SDK

==== Creating AVDs for Development

Once you have installed the SDK, you can create a virtual device
called an AVD. AVDs are very useful because you can see any screen
resolution, any SDK version, and can quickly delete and reset the
devices. In addition, AVDs are created "rooted" by default, which
allows you to view the contents of all files, a capability which is
not available on non-rooted devices. This makes debugging AVDs much
easier because, for example, you can inspect SQLite databases using
command line tools rather than from within a compiled Java
application. Even if you have a physical device, it is worth learning
about AVD management.

To create an AVD, run the `android avd` command from a shell prompt.
You'll see the AVD manager, and can create new devices and manage
existing ones. Mine has multiple AVDs already created; yours will be
empty the first time.

To create a new AVD, click on the "New.." button and follow the
prompts.

You are generally free to choose whatever settings you like. Google
produces a real device called the Nexus 5. This is the Android
reference device, and is a good option for a generic device with good
support across all features. You can choose this one if you are
confused about which to use. 

Once you have created an AVD, start it up. It will take a few minutes
to boot; AVDs are actually emulating the chipset in software and
booting up can take a few minutes, unfortunately. There are ways to
speed up AVD boot time, like the Genymotion tool, but they are outside
of the scope of this book. After your AVD has completed booting, you
can test to see if it is correctly started and available using the adb
command line tool.

[source,bash]
$ adb devices -l
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached 
0222fdc60910aede       device usb:1D110000 product:hammerhead model:Nexus_5 device:hammerhead

Running the adb command starts a daemon service which communicates
with your device. In this case the daemon reported that I have a
single device attached via USB which is a Nexus 5 device.

==== Creating a New Project

[source,bash]
$ mkdir ghoa # GitHub On Android == ghoa
$ cd ghoa
$ android create project --target 13 --name Ghoa --path . --activity MainActivity --package com.example.ghoa 

These three commands create a new directory `ghoa`, enter the
directory, and then build a simple Android directory structure with
the proper files.

If you have the ant tool installed, you can build this new project
with the `ant debug` command. This will create an APK in the bin
directory called `./bin/Ghoa-debug-unaligned.apk`. To install it on
your device run the command `ant debug install`.

===== Adding Gradle support

Gradle is a new build system for Java and has become the offical build
system for the Android platform.
Using a simple `build.gradle` file we can build an entire Android
application from the command line. Gradle is well supported with more
advanced editors, so you can always import an Android project using
Gradle and use it with editors like Eclipse or Android Studio. Ant
used to be the default and preferred method of building Java projects
from the command line, but gradle syntax is so simple and powerful and
lightweight that it is now the preferred build system by the Android team.

Our gradle script allows us to pull in external libraries. We want to
use the egit library which allows us to talk to the GitHub API. Adding
this library to our project is as simple as adding a single dependency
to our project as you see below.

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { 
               url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
         }     
    }
}

apply plugin: 'android'

android {
    compileSdkVersion 18
    buildToolsVersion "18.0.1"
    dependencies {
    'org.eclipse.mylyn.github:org.eclipse.egit.github.core:2.1.5'
    }
}
----

===== Default Android Main

When we use the above commands to create a new android application, it
creates a sample main entry point for us. It looks like this:

[source,java]
-----
package com.whereimat;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class MainActivity extends Activity
{
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
    }
}

-----

When the application is launched, the
Android OS will launch this activity and then call the `onCreate`
method for us. Inside this method, our application calls our parent's
implementation of `onCreate`, and then inflates the layout for our
application. This layout corresponds to an automatically generated XML
file which resides in our layouts directory. This file looks like
this:

[source,java]
-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    >
<TextView
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Hello World, MainActivity"
    />
</LinearLayout>


-----

You may have complicated feelings about XML files (I know I do), but
the Android layout XML files are a straightforward way to design
layouts declaratively, and many of the GUI tools provide sophisticated
ways to manage them. We'll do everything by hand as our needs are simple.

==== Writing tests

Living the GitHub way, we write tests for our application before
writing the code. There are many options for writing
tests on Java and Android. JUnit is a popular testing tool which
permits writing unit tests. Robotium is another testing tool which
focuses on a different aspect of testing, user interface tests. We'll
use a wrapper around Robotium called Calabash for Android which allows
us to write in a high level domain specific language. I find that
writing Calabash tests is a simpler way to write tests using APIs
because Calabash tests interact with the entire application, rather
than only the internals like unit testing. With unit testing you can
be required to mock out network interactions, and as such, often miss
subtle changes in APIs. Calabash also uses a simple DSL which is not
compiled, so refactoring and changing tests is a simple matter. And,
Calabash has a console mode which allows you to interactively refine
your tests. Calabash makes testing easy; your code can be complicated,
but tests should not be an onerous task.

Calabash runs using ruby. You already have ruby installed, so to
install calabash, run these commands:

[source,bash]
$ printf "source 'https://rubygems.org'\n\ngem 'calabash-android'" >> Gemfile
$ bundle install
$ calabash-android gen

Your `Gemfile` should now look like this:

[source,java]
-----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'calabash-android'
-----

We've now installed calabash and created the folder structure to hold
our tests along with some helper scripts. The `calabash-android gen`
command will write out a default calabash feature file like this.

[source,yaml]
-----
Feature: Login feature

  Scenario: As a valid user I can log into my app
    When I press "Login"
    Then I see "Welcome to coolest app ever"

-----

As we do in all the other chapters, let's practice test driven
development. Modify the `my_first.feature` file to look like this:


==== Code to talk to GitHub

We've finally assemble the proper UI for our application. Our last
step is to write the code which handles putting content into GitHub.
This is not a simple function, because the GitHub API requires you
build out the objects required.

This code was refactored from https://gist.github.com/Detelca/2337731.
Who is this mysterious user Detelca? 


[source,java]

String username = getUsername();
String password = getPassword();
RepositoryService rs = getRepositoryService( username, password );
RepositoryBranch rb = getCorrectBranch( rs );
String baseCommitSha = getBaseCommitSha( rb );
commitContents( baseCommitSha, contents );

// create needed services
private RepositoryService getRepositoryService( String username, String password ) {
  RepositoryService repositoryService = new RepositoryService();
  repositoryService.getClient().setOAuth2Token(authToken);
  CommitService commitService = new CommitService();
  commitService.getClient().setOAuth2Token(authToken);
  DataService dataService = new DataService();
  dataService.getClient().setOAuth2Token(authToken);
}

private RepositoryBranch getCorrectBranch( RepositoryService ) {
  // get some sha's from current state in git
  Repository repository =  repositoryService.getRepository(login, repoName);
 List<RepositoryBranch> branches = repositoryService.getBranches(repository);
  RepositoryBranch theBranch = null;
  RepositoryBranch master = null;
  // Iterate over the branches and find gh-pages or master
  for( RepositoryBranch i : branches ) {
      String theName = i.getName().toString();
      if( theName.equalsIgnoreCase("gh-pages") ) {
          theBranch = i;
      }
      else if( theName.equalsIgnoreCase("master") ) {
          master = i;
      }
  }
  if( null == theBranch ) {
      theBranch = master;
  }
  return theBranch;
}

private String getBaseCommitSha( RepositoryBranch rb ) {
  String baseCommitSha = rb.getCommit().getSha();
}

private void commitContents( String baseCommitSha, String contents ) {
  String newSha = null;
  // create new blob with data
  Blob blob = new Blob();
  blob.setContent(contentsBase64);
  blob.setEncoding(Blob.ENCODING_BASE64);
  String blob_sha = dataService.createBlob(repository, blob);
  Tree baseTree = dataService.getTree(repository, baseCommitSha);
  
  // create new tree entry
  TreeEntry treeEntry = new TreeEntry();
  treeEntry.setPath(filename);
  treeEntry.setMode(TreeEntry.MODE_BLOB);
  treeEntry.setType(TreeEntry.TYPE_BLOB);
  
  treeEntry.setSha(blob_sha);
  treeEntry.setSize(blob.getContent().length());
  Collection<TreeEntry> entries = new ArrayList<TreeEntry>();
  entries.add(treeEntry);
  Tree newTree = dataService.createTree(repository, entries, baseTree.getSha());
  
  // create commit
  Commit commit = new Commit();
  commit.setMessage( commitMessage );
  commit.setTree(newTree);
  List<Commit> listOfCommits = new ArrayList<Commit>();
  listOfCommits.add(new Commit().setSha(baseCommitSha));
  // listOfCommits.containsAll(base_commit.getParents());
  commit.setParents(listOfCommits);
  // commit.setSha(base_commit.getSha());
  Commit newCommit = dataService.createCommit(repository, commit);
  
  // create resource
  TypedResource commitResource = new TypedResource();
  commitResource.setSha(newCommit.getSha());
  commitResource.setType(TypedResource.TYPE_COMMIT);
  commitResource.setUrl(newCommit.getUrl());
  
  // get master reference and update it
  Reference reference = dataService.getReference(repository, "heads/" + theBranch.getName() );
  reference.setObject(commitResource);
  Reference response = dataService.editReference(repository, reference, true) ;
  newSha = treeEntry.getSha();
  }
  catch( IOException ieo ) {
      ieo.printStackTrace();
  }
  
  return newSha;
}
