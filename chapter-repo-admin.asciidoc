=== The Danger Zone

image::images/repo-admin-danger.png[]

The Danger Zone is just that - dangerous.   Here you can delete a project, give it away, or expose your code to the public.   Github understands the risk, and because of this every action in the Danger Zone requires explicit authorization and confirmation.

==== Making a Repository Public

Be careful, do you really want to do that?

==== Transfer Repository Ownership

Maybe you started out with a personal account and you want to transfer ownership or a repository to an organization?   Or, maybe you are just sick of a project and want to pass responsibility to someone else?

==== Deleting a Repository

If your project angers you, delete it.
