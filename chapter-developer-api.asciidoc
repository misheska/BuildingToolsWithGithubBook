== The GitHub API
Like most useful sites and services today, GitHub is less a site that
you can visit and more a utility that has a habit of popping up just
about everywhere.  As this book has mentioned previously, GitHub has
been quickly becoming a "fixture" for developers.  If you develop in
Ruby, Node.js, and, increasingly, Java you are going to encounter
GitHub as the foundational SCM used by a number of leading projects
and libraries available for your language or platform.  

This ubiquitous presence continues to develop as GitHub's APIs have
started to mature and offer basic utilities for sites that need to
integrate with it. Just like you can sign on to many services with
your Facebook or Twitter logins, GitHub has started to act as an
OAuth 2 provider for many sites and services that depend on GitHub as
a provider of both user identity and Git activity. 

As more developer-focused sites start to offer the ability to "Login
with GitHub", and as GitHub continues to offer more low-level
infrastructure for development it changes from a simple service to a
necessary infrastructure for collaboration. In more than a few ways, GitHub is
to developers as Facebook is to social networks and the API is a
critical component of that transformation.

This chapter will supply three things: 

* A language-neutral overview of the GitHub API along with an
  explanation of basic interaction patterns and pointers toward more
  detailed information.
* A survey of libraries available to make interacting with the GitHub
  APIs easier.
* An exploration of intergration patterns for GitHub's OAuth
  services.

=== API Overview

The GitHub API is a set of REST services that speak JSON.  Some of
these services are available anonymously without the need for
authentication, while others require a set of credentials.  The API is
easy to access, and this chapter will use a command-line utility named
cURL to demonstrate how to access this API.

.Installing cURL
[NOTE]
If you are running these examples on a Linux box, you should be able
use your native package management tool to install cURL - either a
"sudo yum install curl*" on a RedHat variant or a "sudo apt-get
install curl" on an Ubuntu (or Debian) system.  If you are on any recent version of OSX, you already
have cURL installed, but it you can't find it, take a look at the
MacPorts project (http://www.macports.org/).  If you are running on
Windows or another operating system, you best bet is to download cURL
from the cURL web site here: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

==== Accessing the GitHub API

It's easy, just run curl and hit the API URL as shown in the following
command listing.  Throughout this chapter, we're going to show a
number of command listings that have been edited help us save space in
the book.   I've left the output of this particular call unedited so
we can walk through the response headers and so you can see how the
GitHub tells you where to look for all of the other services it
provides.

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: GitHub.com

Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

----

Let's do a quick walkthrough of this response.   The first thing we
see is a response code.  In this case, our response code is 200 which
signals to us that the request was a success.  Later in this chapter
you will see how GitHub uses other response codes such as HTTP 304 to
send signals to a client.   After the response code, you'll see other
standard headers one would expect in any HTTP response such as the
server sending the response, the date of the response, the Status
header, the Content-Length, and the Content-Type of the response.

Three headers are present in every GitHub API response which tell you
about the GitHub API rate limits.  They are X-RateLimit-Limit,
X-RateLimit-Remaining, and X-RateLimit-Reset.   These limits are
explained in detail in <<developer-api-rates>>.

The X-GitHub-Media-Type header contains information that will come in
handy when you are starting to retrieve text or blob content from the
API.  when you make a request to the GitHub API you can specify the
format you want to work with by sending an Accept header with your request.


After the HTTP response headers shown above, the root directory of the
GitHub API helpfully returns a JSON document listing all of the
services available via the GitHub API.  You can print this out and use
it as a map to the GitHub API.  We're going to run through most of
these services in this chapter, but this is a helpful list to have
access to, and to get it, just go to https://api.github.com/

==== High-level Areas of the GitHub API

Activity::

    Activity includes Events, Feeds, Notifications, Starring, and
    Watching.  If you are building a site or service that is focused
    on supporting developers this portion of the API lets us use the
    GitHub API to display information about activity that affects
    everything: users, repositories, and organizations.

Gists::

    Gists are code snippets that can be shared and embedded in other
    sites. Using the GitHub API you can retrieve and populate Gist
    content and use GitHub as the infrastructure for sharing pieces of code.

Git Data::

    This portion of the API allows you to do anything with the GitHub
    API that you can do with the Git command.  If you are familiar
    with the way that Git's plumbing (not the porcelain) works, you
    could write systems that read, create, and manipulate the basic
    building blocks of Git's content-addressable storage backend
    including blobs, trees, tags, and commits.

Issues::

    GitHub's issues management systems is made fully availabel to you
    via the GitHub API.  If you need to create custom systems to
    create and read GitHub issues, issue comments, issues events,
    issue labels, or if you want to see which issues relate to a
    repository milestone the Issues section of the API is where you'll look.

Orgs::

    Repositoryies and individuals associated with organizations can be
    read and manipualted from the Org Teams API.  If you wanted to
    render a list of developers contributing to a repository on a web
    site you could use this section of the API to obtain this information.

Pull Requests::

    With the Pull Requests section of the GitHub API you can create a
    pull request, view a pull request, updated a pull request, comment
    on a pull request, and merge a pull request.

Repositories::

    The Repos API gives you access to lists of repositories by user
    and by organization. It also provides access to teams, tags,
    branches, and contributors associated with a repository.

Users::

    You can read a user, read the current authenicated user, update
    your own user, list a user's followers, update followers, and
    check to see if a user if following another.  This section of the
    API also allows you to see public keys for a user and 

Search::

    GitHub has spent a good amont of effort over the past few years
    creating a very feature-rich search function and they've made this
    search apability available via the GitHub API.

In summary, you would have to work to figure out something that GitHub
isn't making available via the GitHub API.  They done this for a few
reasons, one is that GitHub has become an essential piece of
infrastructure for a large portion of both open source and proprietary
development.  Allowing other companies and sites to build upon GitHub
via the API only guarantees that it will continue to provide these
features and functions going forward.

The other reason GitHub has invested in what some would consider a
radically open approach to its API is that the founders of the company
understand that they don't hold a monopoly on good ideas. Throughout
its history GitHub has had a track record of nonchalantly allowing
people to do what they will with the service.  By enabling others to
build upon these APIs, GitHub understands that others may show up with
better ideas of how to assemble these functions into viable products.

This isn't to say that GitHub is disinterested in your use of the
API.  The company exists to make money, but as money-making ventures
go, GitHub has yet to exercise the sort of measured caution you would
expect from other, more "corporate" attempts at providing an API.
Nowhere in this API do you see anything that hints of GitHub
attempting to hide a property or make something unavailable to attain
a unique market advantage.  

One thing to keep in mind, despite the current, ideal approach tht
GitHub is taking to its API is that your use of this API is still
subject to the arbitrary whim of a commercial entity.

==== How the Read the Github API Documentation

A full exploration of the GitHub API and fine-grained details for each
service is well beyond the scope of this chapter (or even this entire
book).  For more information about the GitHub API, see the
comprehensive GitHub API documentation here:
http://developer.github.com/v3/

[developer-api-rates]
==== GitHub API Rate Limits

GitHub tries to limit the rate at which users can make requests to the
API.  Anonymous requests, requests that haven't authenticated with
either a username/password or OAuth information, are limited to 60
requests an hour. If you are developing a system to integrate with the
GitHub API on behalf of users, clearly 60 requests per hour isn't
going to be sufficient.

This rate limit is increased to 5000 requests per hour if you are
making an authenticated request to the GitHub API, and while this rate
is two orders of magnitude larger than the anonymous rate limit, it
still presents problems if you intend to use your own GitHub
credentials when making requests on behalf of many users.

For this reason, if your web site or service uses the GitHub API to
request informatin from the GitHub API, you should consider using
OAuth and make requests to the GitHub API using your user's shared
authentication information. 

[NOTE]
There are actually two rate limits.  The "core" rate limit and the
"search" rate limit.  The rate limits explained in the previous
paragraphs were for the core rate limit.  For search, anonymous
requests are limited at 20 requests per minute for authenticated user
requests and 5 request per minute for anonymous requests. The
assumption here is that search is a more infrastructure intensive
request to satisfy and that tighter limits are placed on it's usage.

===== Reading Your Rate Limits
Reading your rate limit is straightforward, just make a GET request to
/rate_limit.  This will return a JSON document which tells you the
limit you are subject to, the number of requests you have remaining,
and the timestamp (in seconds since 1970).  Note that this timestamp
has a timezone in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

The following command listing uses curl to retrieve the rate limit
for an anonymous request.   This response is abbreviated to save space
in this book, but you'll notice that the quota information is supplied
twice: once in the HTTP response headers and again in the JSON
response.  The rate limit headers are returned with every request to
the GitHub API, so there is little need to make a direct call to the
/rate_limit API.

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/rate_limit
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 60
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1376252013

{
  "rate": {
    "limit": 60,
    "remaining": 60,
    "reset": 1376252013
  }
}
----

Again, 60 requests of the course of an hour isn't very much, and if
you plan on doing anything interesting, you will likely exceed this
limit quickly. If you are hitting up against the 60 requests per
minute limit, you will likely want to investigate making authenticated
requests to the GitHub API.

The following command listing uses curl to retrieve the rate limit for
an authenticated request.  Again, you will note that the rate limit
information is present in both the response body and the HTTP response
headers.

----
$ curl -i -u tobrien https://api.github.com/rate_limit
Enter host password for user 'tobrien': xxxxxxxx
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4995
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1376251941

{
  "rate": {
    "limit": 5000,
    "remaining": 4995,
    "reset": 1376251941
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
Calls to the Rate Limit API are not deducted from your Rate Limit.
Isn't that nice of them?

===== Conditional Requests to Avoid Rate Limits

If you are querying the GitHub APIs to obtain activity data for a user
or a repository, there's a good chance that mamy of your requests
won't return much activity.  If you check for new activity once every
few minutes, there will be time periods over which no activity has
occurred.  These requests, these constant polls still use up requests
in your rate limit even though there's no new activity to be
delivered.

In these cases, you can send conditional HTTP headers
If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match to tell GitHub to return an HTTP
304 response code telling you that nothing has been modified.  When
you send a request with a conditional header and the GitHub responds
with a HTTP 304 response code, this request is not deducted from your
rate limit.

The following command listing is an example of passing in the
If-Modified-Since HTTP header to the GitHub API.   Here's we've
specified that we're only interested in receiving content if the
Twitter Boostrap repositories has been altered after 7:49 PM GMT on
Sunday, August 11, 2013.  The GitHub API responds with a HTTP 304
response code which also tells us that the last time this repository
changed was a minute earlier than our cutoff date.

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap \
          -H "If-Modified-Since: Sun, 11 Aug 2013 19:48:59 GMT"
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Server: GitHub.com
Date: Sun, 11 Aug 2013 20:11:26 GMT
Status: 304 Not Modified
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 46
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1376255215
Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=60
Last-Modified: Sun, 11 Aug 2013 19:48:39 GMT
----

The GitHub API also understands HTTP caching tags. An ETag, or Entity Tag, is an HTTP
header that is used to control whether or not content that you have
previously cached is the most recent version.  Here's how your systems
would use ETag:

. Your server requests information from an HTTP server.

.  Server returns an ETag header for a version of a content item.

. Your server includes this ETag in all subsequent requests.

.. If the server has a newer version it returns new content + a new
   ETag

.. If the server doesn't have a newer version it returns an HTTP 304

The following command listing demonstrates to commands.  The first
curl call to the GitHub API generates an ETag value, and the second
value passes this ETag value as an If-None-Match header.  You'll note
that the second response is an HTTP 304 which tells the caller that
there is no new content available.

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=60
Last-Modified: Sun, 11 Aug 2013 20:25:37 GMT
ETag: "462c74009317cf64560b8e395b9d0cdd"

{
  "id": 2126244,
  "name": "bootstrap",
  "full_name": "twbs/bootstrap",
  ....
}

$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap \
          -H 'If-None-Match: "462c74009317cf64560b8e395b9d0cdd"' 

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Status: 304 Not Modified
Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=60
Last-Modified: Sun, 11 Aug 2013 20:25:37 GMT
ETag: "462c74009317cf64560b8e395b9d0cdd"
----

If you are developing an application that needs to make a significant
number of requests to the GitHub API over a long period of time, you
can use a caching HTTP proxy like Squid to take care of automatically
caching content, storing content alongside ETags, and injecting the
"If-None-Match" header into GitHub API requests. If you do this,
you'll be automating the injection of conditional headers and helping
to reduce the overall load on the GitHub API.

Use of conditional request headers is encouraged to conserve resources
and make sure that the infrastructure that supports GitHub's API isn't
asked to generated content unnecessarily.

[developer-api-accept]
==== Specifying Response Content Format

When you send a request to the GitHub API, you have some ability to
specify the format of the response you expect.  For example, if you
are requesting content that contains text from a commit's comment
thread, you can use the Accept header to ask for the raw markdown or
for the HTML this markdown generates.  You also have the ability to
specify this version of the GitHub API you are using.  At this point,
you can specify either version 3 or beta of the API.

To demonstrate the specification of the Accept header, let's take a
look at what happens when we request something without the Accept
header:

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-GitHub-Media-Type: github.beta
----

You can see that GitHub API assumes that you are requesting the
beta version and for results to be returned as JSON. This is the
default behavior of the GitHub API. GitHub is currently developing v3
of the GitHub API and has marked the current version of this stable
API as "beta".  This is the default version that it returned.  At some
point in the future, GitHub may decide to release a final version of
v3 and move to a new version identifier.

When making an individual service call you can specify the version of
the API as follows:

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/ \
          -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-GitHub-Media-Type: github.v3; format=json
----

Note how the content of the X-GitHub-Media-Type header changed to
reflect the newly specified version number.  In addition to these
changes, the following sections outline further customization of
response format with the Accept Header.

////
Fact check GitHub v3 assertion above.
////

===== Retrieving Formatted Content

The Accept header you send with a request can affect the format of
text returned by the GitHub API.  As an example, let's assume you
wanted to read the body of a GitHub Issue. An Issue's body is stored
in Markdown and can be retrieved with the following request by sending
"application/vnd.github.beta.raw+json" as the Accept header.

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11819 \
          -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.beta.raw+json"
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-GitHub-Media-Type: github.beta; param=raw; format=json

...Content Removed...

  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have a problem with strong parameters in
  rails 4. \r\n\r\nI have a one-to-many association that accept nested
  attributes.\r\n\r\nI try to permit nested attributes with following
  line :\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nevent_params =
  params.require(:event).permit(:description,
  \r\nevent_parts_attributes: [:start_date,
  :start_time])\r\n```\r\n\r\ndescription is present but
  event_parts_attributes aren't added to event_params. They are well
  present in params.\r\n\r\nWhen I remove require(:event) it's
  work. \r\n\r\nThanks",
----

As you can see in the response returned above, the body of this Issue
is returned in a raw, unformatted response. If you were consuming this
and displaying it to users, it would be up to you to parse and render
the Markdown in this Issue body.  If you were attempted to retrieve an
Issue body with Javascript to display to an end-user, you might want
to retrieve the body as rendered HTML content.  Here's how you would
do that with the Accept header passing in
"application:vnd.github.beta.html+json" in the Accept header.

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11819 \
          -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.beta.html+json"
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-GitHub-Media-Type: github.beta; param=html; format=json

  ...Content Removed...

  "body_html": "<p>Hi, </p>\n\n<p>I have a problem with strong
  parameters in rails 4. </p>\n\n<p>I have a one-to-many association
  that accept nested attributes.</p>\n\n<p>I try to permit nested
  attributes with following line :</p>\n\n<div
  class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"n\">event_params</span> <span
  class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">params</span><span
  class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">require</span><span
  class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">:event</span><span
  class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span
  class=\"n\">permit</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span
  class=\"ss\">:description</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> \n<span
  class=\"n\">event_parts_attributes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>
  <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"ss\">:start_date</span><span
  class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"ss\">:start_time</span><span
  class=\"o\">]</span><span
  class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>description is present but
  event_parts_attributes aren't added to event_params. They are well
  present in params.</p>\n\n<p>When I remove require(:event) it's
  work. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>",

----

Besides "raw" and "html" there are two other format options that
influence how Markdown content is delivered via the GitHub API.  If
you specify "text" as a format, the issue body would have been
returned as plaintext.   If you specify "full" then the content will
be rendered multiple times including the raw Markdown, rendered HTML,
and rendered plaintext.

In addition to controlling the format of text content, you can also
retrieve GitHub blobs either as raw binary or as a BASE64 encoded
text.   When retrieving commits, you can also specify that the content
be returned either as a diff or as a patch.  For more information
about these fine-grained controls for formatting, see the GitHub API
documentation here: http://developer.github.com

===== Preview Version Required for Search API

Note that the Search API is a separate version.  To use the Search API
you must specify the Accept header in your request as
"application/vnd.github.preview+json".  The following command listing
demonstrates the use of curl to search repositories while specifying
the appropriate Media type.

----
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=@tobrien \
          -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.preview+json"
----

Failure to specify the preview version in the Accept header will
result in an HTTP 404 Not Found result.

[developer-api-terms]
==== GitHub API Terms of Service

Before you start building a system atop another service's API, it is
always wide to understand what, if any, limitations are placed on that
API's usage.Aside from the limitations on bandwidth, GitHub's API is also covered
by the overall GitHub Terms of Service.   While you can read these terms of
servic here: https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service
- here is a summary of the terms.

. GitHub isn't liable for any damages that result from youruse of the
API.  You really can't blame GitHub for putting up this clause in
today's litigious society.

. If you abuse the API, GitHub can suspend your account's access to
the API.  They will attempt to contact you before this happens.

. They can change the API.  They can discontinue a part of the API.
They can change it without notice.

This is fairly standard stuff when it comes to terms for an API.
We're not liable, don't abuse it, and we can change it or take it
away.

////
We need guidance from GitHub here.  I don't see that the GitHub API
has any explicit Terms of Service beyond the one every user agrees
to.   It would be nice to know if there are any red lines that can't
be crossed.
////

=== API Security

How is a call to the API secured?

==== Unauthenticated Usage

Public usage of the API, briefly discuss any limitations for
unauthenticated usage.

==== Connecting as Yourself

Just describe simple authentication, how can you make calls to Github
as your own user.

==== Connecting as Someone Else (OAuth)

Reference the larger section on OAuth below.

=== API Libraries

There are already a number of API Libraries available for the Github
API.  This section lists some of the major languages along with some
of the options.

The first two sections of this chapter will deal with the official,
GitHub-maintained client libraries. GitHub maintains two official
libraries which are grouped under the name Octokit - a reference to
Github's Feline Octopus mascot "Octocat".  Octokit maintains two
projects on GitHub - octokit.rb and octokit.objc.

==== Connecting to Github from Objective-C

////
TBD
////




==== Connecting to Github from Ruby

Just have a simple example using the most popular library.  Simple ,
then just some of the alternatives.

https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb

gem install octokit

////
TBD

==== Connecting to Github from Javascript (Client-side)

Just have a simple example using the most popular library.  Simple ,
then just some of the alternatives.

The following example depends on jQuery, Underscore, and the gh3
Javascript library maintained by Philippe Charriere (GitHub: @k33g) at
GitHub here: https://github.com/k33g/gh3

To run the following example, download underscore-min.js from
http://underscorejs.org/ and gh3.js from https://github.com/k33f/gh3, and
place these files in the same directory as an HTML

==== Connecting to Github from Java

The Eclipse project's EGit project maintains a Java library named
egit-github which can be usd independently of Eclipse to interact with
the GitHub API.  The GitHub project page for this egit-github project
can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse/egit-github

If you are using Maven the dependency XML for egit-github is the
following XML dependency.

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.mylyn.github</groupId>
  <artifactId>org.eclipse.egit.github.core</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.5</version>
</dependency>

package com.oreilly.github;

import org.eclipse.egit.github.core.Repository;
import org.eclipse.egit.github.core.client.GitHubClient;
import org.eclipse.egit.github.core.client.PageIterator;
import org.eclipse.egit.github.core.event.Event;
import org.eclipse.egit.github.core.service.EventService;

    {
        GitHubClient client = new GitHubClient();
        EventService service = new EventService();
        PageIterator<Event> iterator = service.pageUserEvents("tobrien");

        for (Event event : iterator.next() )
          System.out.printf( "%s %s\n", event.getType(), event.getCreatedAt());
    }

==== Connecting to Github from Node.js
There is a popular node library that provides access to the GitHub API
developed by Mike de Boer (GitHub: @mikedeboer) this Node.js library
can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github

To install the JavaScript GitHub API for Node.js.  Run the following
command with npm - the Node.js package manager:

----
npm install github
----

Once you've installed the github package, you can reference the GitHub
library in code like the following code listing.

----
var GitHubApi = require("github");
var prettyjson = require( 'prettyjson' );

var github = new GitHubApi({
    version: "3.0.0",
    timeout: 5000
});

github.events.getFromUser({
    user: "tobrien"
}, function(err, res) {
    console.log(prettyjson.render(res));
});
----

The code shown above connects to GitHub's API and requests recent
events related to the user "tobrien".  The result of the API call is
then printed out using a utility library named "prettyjson" which
ensures that the JSON output is transformed into something easier to
read. To run this code, you will need to run the following commands:

----
$ npm install github
$ npm install prettyjson
$ node github.js
----

Running this command should yield JSON output that contains a list of
events and actions the user 'tobrien' has recently completed.

For detailed document of Mike de Boer's JavaScript GitHub API, you can
read the full library documentation here:
http://mikedeboer.github.io/node-github/.

While the simple example shown above is sufficient for read-only
operations in the GitHub API, if you are planning on using this API
for anything more than reading GitHub content, you will need to
configure authentication options for this library.  A full discussion
of authentication with the JavaScript GitHub API for Node.js can be
found on the GitHub project page for this library here:
https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github


==== Connecting to Github from a Billion Alternative Languages

Here is where you can have a list of the availablt APIs, but not a big
one.    We don't need to bother with langauges like Fortran 90.

=== Developing Github Applications

Building systems that interact with Github

===== Example Use-cases for Github Applications

* For discounts at business-affiliated services. (Publishers like O'Reilly Atlas, Prags, Pluralsight)

* For automation integration like Travis-CI

* For sign-in to credentialing services like [CoderWall](http://coderwall.com)

* For sign-in to reputation services like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)

===== Authorizing Github Applications

When you develop an application that needs to make use of Github they
need to be authorized using an OAuth workflow...

===== How does OAuth Work?

 [OAuth](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/)

===== OAuth Libraries for Github

===== Ruby: Omniauth (with Devise)

Omniauth already has a OAuth provider for Github.

===== Python: ???

Todo: I know that Django has an OAuth provider API, ask a Pythonista.

===== Other Languages

Figure out if there are any other pre-built OAuth integrations (like omniauth)


=== A Sample Github Application

This section would build out a sample application.

=== Organization Applications
