=== Gists

Gists are great for code sharing. To create one, you can go to gist.github.com and enter in some code. You 
then choose public or private and create the gist.

==== Gists are repositories

Every gist created is a tiny repository. You can update gists and see the history.

==== Caveats: flat file structure

You can use gists to store entire functioning apps. Let's create a simple Sinatra app.

Sinatra is a ruby library for creating dead-simple web servers. A sinatra program looks as
simple as this:

[code,ruby]
require 'sinatra'

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end

Create a gist for this by visiting gist.github.com. Enter in the text exactly as above and then choose
public gist.

You now have a shareable gist of code, which anyone can use to review this code. More importantly, this
is an executable piece of code. To use it, click into the "Clone this gist" box to the left of the body of 
content. You'll get a URL which looks something like this:

https://gist.github.com/8138797.git

Copy this and then enter a terminal program and enter this command:

[source,bash]
$ git clone https://gist.github.com/8138797.git
$ cd 8138797

Now, you are inside the gist repository. If you look inside the repository you'll see a list of files, which 
right now numbers only one.

[source,bash]
$ ls
hi.rb

To run this code, enter `ruby hi.rb`

If you had not used ruby before, this will cause an error. This program requires a library called "sinatra" and
you have not yet installed it. We could write a README, or add documentation into this file itself. Another
way to guarantee the user has the proper files installed is to use a "Gemfile" which is a file that tells
which libraries are installed and from where. Let's add this:

[source,bash]
$ printf "source 'https://rubygems.org'\ngem 'sinatra'" > Gemfile

This is a quick way to add content to the file named Gemfile. To install the libraries required here, we run
the bundler command

[source,bash]
$ bundle
Using rack (1.5.2) 
Using rack-protection (1.5.1) 
Using tilt (1.4.1) 
Using sinatra (1.4.4) 
Using bundler (1.3.5) 
Your bundle is complete!
Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.

This shows that we installed the library "sinatra" and the associated dependencies (rack, tilt and other associated
libraries). 

Why did we do things this way? Because now we can add this file to our repository locally, and then publish
into our gist for sharing on the web.

First, we need to update the "remote". Run this command:

[source,bash]
$ git remote -v
origin       https://gist.github.com/8138797.git (fetch)
origin       https://gist.github.com/8138797.git (push)

Your results will be slightly different, but this output displays our remote repository; in other words, where
we pull and push our code changes. If you are familiar with the

=== Discovering Gists

Gists can be searched, but the interface is must simpler than the
interface for the search interface discussed previously in this
chapter.  To get the Gists search feature, go to
https://gist.github.com/search - type in a search term and the only
filtering function you'll be able to see is a filter by Gist language.
