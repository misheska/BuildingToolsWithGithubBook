== Issues

* ObjectiveC
* mitmproxy
** record
** playback
* Store recordings as gists
** Why not put recordings into the source repository directly?
*** Because often times your QA team does not have access to the
      code, but does need access to reproduction steps.
* JIRA integration, an additional layer over issues? Perhaps using
  JIRA for scrum tracking?
* Add an extra forgotten feature but add script to mitmproxy to 
  rewrite responses and store results inside a gist.
