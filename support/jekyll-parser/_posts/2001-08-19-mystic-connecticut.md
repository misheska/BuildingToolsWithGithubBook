WE STAYED AT A WONDERFUL, UNIQUE BED AND BREAKFAST INN LAST 
FALL. THIS PLACE TAKES A STEP BACK INTO HISTORY. THE 
BUILDING WAS BUILT IN THE 1700'S, AND IS HISTORICALLY 
CORRECT IN THE FURNISHINGS. IF ANYONE LOVES REAL ANTIQUES 
AND NOT JUST FAKE OR "CUTE CURTAINS" DECORATING, GO THERE. 
THE NAME IS RED BROOK INN, MYSTIC
