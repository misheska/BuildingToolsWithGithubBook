Translation -  "Foreigners in India"Well since we last wrote we were heading for India.On our way there we stopped in at Chitwan Nat. Par

Nepal Border) to experience elephant riding whil

ooking for various species of animal including th

ne horned rhino and the tiger in the local jungle. W

ere lucky to spot the one horned rhino but no luck o

he tiger front. We also had fun bathing the elephant

e joined it in the river sitting on its back an

etting soaked in the process by either it spraying u

ith its trunk or just dunking us. A great experience.Varanasi was our next stop where we enjoyed a daw

oat ride on the Ganges veiwing the locals dail

itual of bathing, washing and even dying in th

anges. With respect to the latter, before the bodie

re cremated next to the Ganges, they are doused int

he Ganges to purify their soul for afterlife

aranasi or Benares as it is known to the locals ha

o be seen to be believed for the out and ou

olution, be it from carbon monoxide to cowshit!! Cow

re allowed to roam free in Hindu countries whic

auses chaos at times with the traffic. I also got t

lay cricket with the locals in the narrow alleys o

he old town but had to avoid the brown cowpatts i

he process! It was quite coincidental that the N

ricket team was playing India at the same time.We then headed to Bandhavgarh Nat Park where we struc

ucky seeing the Bengal tiger in the wild on a numbe

f occasions. It was pretty awesome to see it in th

lesh so close in its natural environment. Definitel

 highlight in India so far. For the record this par

as the highest density of tigers for any nationa

ark in India, so the odds of getting to see a tige

re better than average.Khajuraho was where Victoria and I got to view th

amous erotic sculptures embedded in the temples o

he village. I will be sure to practice a few ne

ositions for the honeymoon!!Orchha was our next stop which is famous for it

alace and outerlying temples which were built in th

7 century during the Mughal period. The Mughal

ertainly know how to build - massive. We spoil

urselves with a night in the palace. I'm definitel

n Victoria's good books for that!!In Bharatpur we visited Keoladeo Ghana Natl Park, 

amous migratory birds sanctuary built 300 years ag

y a local Maharaja for his sporting pleasure o

hooting waterfowl. Now, about a third of the park i

looded which makes a perfect location to see th

ndangered Siberian crane along with many herons

tags, and geese to name just a few, which we di

hile riding on bicycles. Then another major highlight, in Agra - the Taj Mahal

his has got to one of the most amazing man mad

onders of the world. The whole building is built ou

f solid marble and took 22 years to build yet onl

ne day to take down the scaffolding! Once again th

ughals are resonsible for the building of th

ausoleum. Agra is also famous for its Red Fort whic

as been the most impressive we've seen thus far

lthough I hear the forts in Rajastan are equall

mpressive.Now we are in New Delhi and have caught up on chore

nd spoilt ourselves with a few western comforts. No

o mention do some shopping. We have also had a lot o

un riding around in the auto-rickshaws (3 wheeled 

troke engine taxis) visiting both New Delhi (Britis

olonial influence) and Old Delhi (just manic traffi

nd bazaars)Thanks to those who responded and gave us a run dow

f what you have been up to.
