I went diving in Dubrovnik this morning. Anton met me at hi

hop down the road the pertol station in Lapad. We geared u

nd left out to one of the islands a few kilometers from shore.The first stop we made was for a cave dive. It was just th

wo of us, so Anton dropped his gear into the water afte

illing his BCD vest with air, and helped me into my tw

etsuits, one with a hood, and then into my BCD. I droppe

nto the water and then he followed. I was glad that he ha

uggested the second wetsuit, since the water was clear bu

xtremely cold, and got colder as we went deeper.As we went around the walls near the island, we sa

ountless beds of coral, some with orange colored algae, bu

ost with a dark green. There were sea urchins everywhere

ost of them had a half shell stuck in their thorns, despit

he fact that there is no way their spines could pierce 

lam shell. I think this is the same phenomenon as teenag

oys who wear "Elevate and decide in the air" basketbal

-shirts. Sort of a ridiculous badge of honor. Their wer

ven albino sea urchins down there, or perhaps they wer

ead and had lost all their purple.After trolling around the edge of the island, we came acros

 black hole in the wall. I had only about a fourth of 

ank left, but Anton motioned that this was OK, and w

roceeded into it. On the surface he had said that it wen

ack about 200 meters. It seems now like this was muc

xaggerated, maybe my excitement caught up with me. Anto

eld an underwater flashlight, and I followed the light mor

han I followed him. The "cave" was in reality more of 

rack in the wall, and I slithered through with my tan

umping against the walls on the side and above me, an

ried to keep up with Anton. As we came around the edge o

he cave his light disappeared several times which wa

nconfortable. Finally we arrived at a open area and I coul

ee the surface of the water as Anton pointed the flashligh

pward. Ascending slowly, we broke the surface. Everythin

as black inside the cave without Anton's flashlight. Whe

e shined it on the roof, a few feet above us, we could se

iny stalagtites, brownish and gooey. Anton said they looke

ike shark's teeth, and I thought this was a prett

nappropriate observation at that time. We then went bac

nto the water and he pointed to the entrance, and we coul

ee the light blue crack from the opposite side.As it turned out we descended to about 38 meters. I didn'

ave a depth gauge on my regulator, so I had no idea. Th

ater was so clear and bright that I had thought we hadn'

ropped beneath 15 meters or so. We were under for around 4

inutes, which was a pretty long time for the depth we wer

t, although this wasn't our total bottom time.After we ascended and rested a bit, Anton said that we woul

hen visit a bomb dropped during WWII by the Germans, an

hen proceed to a wreck and then see another cave. In fac

e saw three German bombs at the bottom. All of them wer

ompletely corroded and you could see that they were empt

nside. Borin the cab driver had told me that some peopl

ere in Dubrovnik would take mines found around the area an

tuff them into fish which would then explode in the wate

ater. Didn't look like there was much in the way of liv

mmunition down there, due in part to the heavy salt water

ut one thing is for sure, war leaves even more than jus

eath and hatred.After we looped around the first German bomb, we descende

o see the sunken ship. The hull had almost completel

ettled into the ocean floor so you could only see the to

f it, but many other pieces of the boat remained scattere

bout. Anton said it was a tourist boat which ha

nfortunately encountered engine problems, and the Serbs ha

hot it down with machine guns. Only a few people had die

pparently. It was strange to see such geometric shapes i

he water after seeing the smooth rockiness of the coral i

he earlier dive. Another bomb sat on the floor next to th

reck. Lots of fish gathered about it as well; wreck

sually provide shelter similar to natural reefs for th

arine life, and this one was no different. In a few year

he sea will probably have beaten it to a pulp and the shi

ill return to the dust. As we went in the direction of th

ave, Anton seemed almost clairvoyant as he found severa

ittle octopus, and a sea eel which had a head the size of 

 coke bottle and probably several feet in length. Mayb

ven the sea animals are interested in improving tourism i

roatia? After he found his friends, I looked and looked

ut nothing ever looked different than grey sand until Anto

ointed his light at something and it jetted off in a clou

f black ink.Finally, we reach the other cave. As a now experienced cav

iver, I had less anxiety in entering this one. This agai

as somewhat like a crack in the wall. This cave, however

pened into the air within some rocky walls going up. "Thi

s like a little lake," mentioned Anton. We then descende

ack into the water, and followed the crack down. After w

eached the boat, Anton informed me that we had reached 2

eters at the lowest depth. Getting back into the boat, th

illings in my teeth stung a little bit from the pressur

ver the two dives.These two dives, stretching over a few hours, cost me aroun

80, two dives ($58), including equipment rental ($20), th

roatian diving license good for one year (about 100 Kuna o

12), and the free boat ride out. Well worth it. Anton ca
