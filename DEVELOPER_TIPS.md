Editing files on your laptop.

I use pow.cx to host the service on my local dev machine. And,
live-reload to regenerate the pages as I edit them and watch inside
the browser.

* Install pow.cx
* Install the powder gem
* Install live-reload into your Chrome browser
* Install guard gem
* Run `guard` from the current directory
* From the current dir, run `powder link`
* Open one of the docs, like http://1234000000486.dev/chapter-10-jekyll.asciidoc.html

If you are editing files using the oreilly-snippets gem, then make
sure you edit files inside the pre/ directory. Refer to
