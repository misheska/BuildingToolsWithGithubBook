     });
   })


   We create a new Github() object using the constructor. This constructor can
   take user credentials, but for now, we can just create it without those since

   we are accessing a public repository.

   Once we have our   github   object, we call the method  getRepo()   with a

   owner and a name. This returns our repository object.


   To actually load the data for this repository object, we call the show method
   and pass it a callback which uses the two parameters err and  repo to han-

   dle errors or otherwise provide us with details of the repository specified. In
   this case we are using the Gollum wiki public repository to display some
   sample data.


   Once we have loaded the repository data, we need to call $apply  to tell An-

   gular a change has occurred to the scope variable.

   So, Github.js handles making the proper request to Github for us, and Angu-
larJS handles putting the results into our web page.

   If you load this up in your browser, you will see something like this:

   Yikes, that is a lot of data. AngularJSâ€™s JSON filter pretty printed it for us, but

this is a bit too much. Change the HTML to be like this:

   <html>

   <head>
   <title>CoffeeTe.ch</title>
