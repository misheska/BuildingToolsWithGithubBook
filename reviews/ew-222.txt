CHAPTER 9: JavaScript and the Git Data API


                       FIXING AUTHENTICATION WITH FIREBASE

                       Instead of writing our own server to manage authentication and talk to the Git-

                       Hub API, we will delegate that authentication to Firebase. Firebase is a real time
                       communication toolset which integrates well with our choice of AngularJS. By

                       far the simplest and safest option, Firebase offers AngularJS bindings (called
                       “AngularFire”) and an integrated GitHub authentication component (called

                       “Simple Login”). Together they resolve the authentication issue for us, and keep
                       all our code hosted on GitHub. Delegation of our authentication component is
                       easy with Firebase: we just modify our existing GitHub application, provide the

                       credentials and GitHub oAuth scope to Firebase, and then our application off-
                       loads user management to Firebase.

                          First, we need to create a new GitHub application. In the top right corner on
                       GitHub.com, click on the “Account settings” link, and then navigate to the “Ap-

                       plications” link towards the bottom. Click on the “Developer Applications” tab
                       in the right center column and then click on the “Register new application” but-

                       ton. Make sure “Authorization callback URL” is set to   https://auth.fire-
                       base.com/auth/github/callback        . Then save the application by clicking on

                       the “Register application” button.
