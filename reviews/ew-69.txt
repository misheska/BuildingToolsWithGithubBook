   As you can see, our packed-size has barely changed, an indication that the

only changes were a new Git tree object and commit object. We still do have the
files located in our repository at a variety of paths so our review pages will work

no matter what revision we are accessing.

   Git and Gollum can efficiently store the same file at different paths without

overloading the repository.


Reviewing on GitHub


The raison d’etre for this wiki is to annotate a development project. If you fol-
low the instructions above and create a new wiki for a repository, you’ll then be

able to push up the changes we’ve made using our  image.rb  script. Once you
have created a new wiki, look for a box on the right which says “Clone this wiki

locally”.
