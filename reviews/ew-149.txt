   Not very pretty at all. We can beautiful this by adding some styling to the
page. We’ll use Bootstrap, the most popular CSS framework on GitHub. To start,

edit the layout to include Bootstrap from the Bootstrap CDN. And, add acon-
tainer  class around the content.


   <html>
   <head>

   <title>ByTravelers.com</title>

   <link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

   </head>


   <body>

   {{ content }}


   </body>
   </html>


   Notice that our files are regenerated in the terminal window with jekyll
serve -w  . Refreshing the page shows some improvement, but we can do bet-

ter. Let’s make a front page which shows just the ten most recent post, and an
archive page which shows all the posts in reverse chronological order.
