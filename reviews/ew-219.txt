Accepting the user contribution via a pull request


When someone makes an annotation to a shop, the owner of the original repos-
itory gets a pull request notification on GitHub.



                                                                                    FIGURE 9-5






















   As the owner of this repository and manager of this data, I like managing
contributions using pull requests inside GitHub. In my humble opinion, there

are no better tools for managing and reviewing changes of information than
those found on GitHub. This is a simple case of adding data and might look like

overkill at this scale. You could imagine, however, that were you to have thou-
sands of users, making many contributions per day, that all of a sudden you

would need a complex system for managing, reviewing and accepting changes
to your data set. GitHub gives you all these tools: diffâ€™ing files, user manage-
ment in case you wanted to delegate review to other people in your organiza-

tion, among many other features GitHub provides. This may not be the most
obvious way to manage a database of information, but there are compelling

reasons to consider it against a traditional database like Postgresql or Mysql.
