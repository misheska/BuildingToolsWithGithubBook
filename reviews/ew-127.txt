                                                                                 A Jekyll Blog in 15 Minutes


     The jekyll watch switch does reload all HTML and markup files, but does
     not reload the _config.yml file. If you make changes to it, you will need
     to stop and restart the server.



   If you are running multiple Jekyll sites on the same laptop, you’ll quickly
find that the second instance of  jekyll serve     fails because it cannot open

port 4000. In this case, usejekyll --port 4010      to open port 4010 (or what-
ever port you wish to use instead).


Privacy Levels with Jekyll


Jekyll repositories on GitHub can be either public or private repositories. If your

repository is public you can host public content generated from the Jekyll
source files without publishing the source files themselves. Remember, as no-

ted previously, that any file without publishing: false      inside the YFM will
be made public the moment you push it into your repository.


Themes


Jekyll does not support theming internally, but it is trivial to add any CSS files

or entire CSS frameworks. You could do this yourself, or you could just fork an
existing jekyll blog which has the theming you like. The most popular themed
Jekyll blog structure is Octopress. We don’t display this here, but you another

easy option is to add the Bootstrap CSS library just as we did in the Chapter 9
chapter.



Publishing on GitHub

Once you have your blog created, you can easily publish it to GitHub. There are

two ways which you can publish Jekyll blogs:

    • As a github.io site

    • On a domain you own

   Github offers free personal blogs which are hosted on the github.io domain.
And, you can host any site with your own domain name with a little bit of con-

figuration.
