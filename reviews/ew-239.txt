                                                                                           Our Blueprint


   Now that we have a simple Hubot created we need to create the Slack site
where our Hubot will live.



Creating a Slack Account

Going to slack.com starts you on the process to create your own Slack site.

You’ll need to step through creating an account. Slack sites are segmented by
organization, and you’ll want to establish a URL prefix for your Slack site. Typi-

cally this is the name of your organization.


NAMING THE CHANNEL

Once you have your slack site created, you need to create a channel.




                                                                                   FIGURE 10-1



























   You can name the channel anything you want, but it is often a good
mnemonic to use a name which suggests this is a channel where more serious

work gets done. You could use a name like “PR Discussion” to indicate this is
the channel where PRs are discussed. To keep things simple, we will use the
name “#general”. Once you click on the link to create a channel, you’ll see a

popup asking for the name and an optional description.  After you have created
the channel, you will see a link to “Add a service integration.”
