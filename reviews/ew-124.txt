                          Hopefully you’ll agree this is a fairly intuitive and readable alternative to raw

                       HTML. This simplicity and readability is one of the major benefits of using Je-
                       kyll. Your source files maintain a readability that allows you to focus on the con-

                       tent itself, not on the technology that will eventually make them beautiful. Let’s
                       go over this file and investigate some of the important pieces.


                       YFM: YAML Front Matter


                       The first thing we see in a Jekyll file is the YAML Front Matter (YFM).

                          YFM is a snippet of YAML (“YAML Aint Markup Language”) delimited by three

                       hyphens on both the top and bottom. YAML is a simple structured data seriali-
                       zation language used by many open source projects instead of XML. Many peo-
                       ple find it more readable and editable by humans than XML. The YFM in this file

                       shows a few configuration options: a layout, the title, the date and a list of cate-
                       gories.

                          The layout specified references one of the files in o_layouts   directory. If
                       you don’t specify a layout file in the YFM, then Jekyll assumes you want to use a

                       file calledefault.html    to wrap your content. You can easily imagine adding
                       your own custom layout files to this directory and then overriding them in the

                       YFM. If you look at this file, you see that it manually specifiposthelayout.
                          The title is used to generate t<title>   tag and can be used anywhere else
                       you need it inside your template using the double braces syntax from Liquid:

                       {{ page.title }}    . Notice that any variable from th_config.yml   file is pre-
                       fixed with the site.  namespace, while variables from your YFM are prefixed

                       with page. . Though the title matches the filename (after replacing spaces with
                       hyphens), changing the title in the YFM does not affect the name of the URL

                       generated by Jekyll. If you want to change the URL, you need to rename the file
                       itself. This is a nice benefit if you need to slightly modify the title and don’t want

                       to damage preexisting URLs.
