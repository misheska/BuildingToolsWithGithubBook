                           Taking the URL from Chrome, we can use this as our starting point for scrap-

                        ing. Clicking around throughout the site, it becomes evident that each URLs to
                        a journal entry uses a standard format; in other words,   http://www.bytrav-

                        elers.com/journal/entry/56         indicates the 56th journal item stored on the
                        site. With this knowledge in hand, we can iterate over the first hundred or so

                        URLs easily.
                           Going to one of these pages through the archived site, it is useful to view the

                        source of the page and start to understand the structure of a page which we can
                        then use when pointing our mechanize scraper at the page to pull out content.

                        Any modern web browser supports a debug mode, and Chrome (my browser of
                        choice) supports this as well. If we hold down the control key and click (at least

                        on Mac OSX; righting-click on Windows or Linux works in the same way) into the
                        “body” of a journal entry on its page, we will see a context menu that gives us

                        the option to “Inspect Element”. Chosing this option brings up the Chrome De-
                        veloper Tools and shows us the HTML code of the page pretty printed for us.
