Summary


Our Probot is alive! We went through building a robot which can interact with
us inside a chat room, then refactored the robot so that its functionality is con-
tained into a highly testable module. Along the way, we got intimate with the

Hubot API, and even discussed how to modify (and the drawbacks surrounding)
modifying the source code to Hubot itself. Finally we demonstrated how to use

the Activities API receiving (and faking data) coming a GitHub webhook. There
is a natural fit to Hubot and the GitHub API, and this chapter shows how easy
and fun it can be. Using Hubot you can amplify and streamline developer work-

flow within the dialog happening between your vibrant developers and this
helpful robot.
