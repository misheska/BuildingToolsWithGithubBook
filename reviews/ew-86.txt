CHAPTER 5: Python and the Search API


                      configuration options. If you’ve written GUI applications before, you’ll know

                      how hard each of these problems are.

                      The Code


                      Alright, now you have an idea of which parts of the Python ecosystem will be
                      helping us on our journey. Let’s get started looking at the code that brings them

                      all together. We’ll start with this skeleton file:

                         #!/usr/bin/env python


                         import os, subprocess
                         import wx
                         from agithub import Github


                         class SearchFrame(wx.Frame):
                              pass

                         if __name__ == '__main__':
                              app = wx.App()

                              SearchFrame(None)
                              app.MainLoop()

                         If you run this program, you should get an empty window, which is always a

                      hopeful start to any project. Let’s take a look at a few key things:

                         The “shebang” specifies that this is a Python 2.7 program


                         Here we import our handy libraries. We import WxPython ( wx ) whole cloth,

                         but with agithub  we only need the  Github  (note the capitalization) class.
                         os and subprocess   come from the Python standard library.


                         This is the class for our main window. We’ll walk through the particulars lat-
                         er on when we discuss the real implementation.


                         In Python, you create the main entry point of an application using this syn-
                         tax.
