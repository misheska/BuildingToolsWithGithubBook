Publishing our blog to GitHub


Like any other GitHub repository, we can then publish our blog using the same
commands we saw with earlier repositories. Obviously you should change the

username and blog name to suit your own needs.


   $ export BLOG_NAME=xrd/bytravelers.com
   $ gem install hub
   $ hub create $BLOG_NAME # You might need to login here
   $ sleep $((10*60)) && open $BLOG_NAME


   And, don’t forget to setup DNS records and give yourself appropriate time to
let those records propagate out.



Summary


We’ve shown that we can quickly setup a blog on GitHub that has version con-
trol built in. We’ve shown how to import blogs like Wordpress into Jekyll. And,
we’ve taken a site available only as an archive on the Internet Archive and scra-

ped the content, images and even the colors, and then converted it to a Jekyll
blog. Jekyll is a simple tool for managing websites, but a hidden benefit is that

because Jekyll is so simple, you can easily write your own tools to interact and
build on top of Jekyll. Once our site is a repository on GitHub, making changes
yourself, or accepting them from other contributors is as easy as clicking

“Merge” on a pull request.
   In the next chapter we will continue looking at Jekyll by building an Android

application that uses the Java GitHub API bindings and allows you to create Je-
kyll blog posts with the Git Data API.
