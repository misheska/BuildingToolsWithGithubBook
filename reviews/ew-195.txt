                                                                Building a Coffee Shop Database on GitHub


INSERTING GITHUB DATA USING GITHUB.JS

Let’s add some GitHub data to our HTML file. Change the  index.html   file as

follows.

   <html>

   <head>
   <title>CoffeeTe.ch</title>
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap.min.css"></link>
   </head>

   <body ng-app="coffeetech">
   <div class="container" ng-controller="GithubCtrl">
   {{ repo | json }}
   </div>

   <script src="angular.js"></script>
   <script src="github.js"></script>
   <script src="coffeetech.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>


   We added or changed just three lines.


   We added a reference to ourcoffeetech.js    file beneath our other JS refer-
   ences.


   We removed our databinding to the   Welcome to CoffeeTech      string and

   replaced it with a binding to the variarepo filtered by the JSON filter.

   Finally, we changed the ng-app  reference to use the module we defined in

   our coffeetech.js   file.

   If you have never used AngularJS before, you are probably thoroughly con-

fused about the  coffeetech.js   file. Before we dive into the syntax, under-
stand the following features of AngularJS, and then you’ll understand the signif-

icant problems solved by those same features:

    • AngularJS utilizes something called two-way databinding. AngularJS sol-
      ves the problem you have with building JS apps: marshalling data from

      your JS code into your HTML templates, marshalling data from your AJAX
      calls into your JS code and then marshalling that into your HTML tem-
      plates. Marcia, Marcia, Marcia! Enough already: allow AngularJS to do this

      heavy lifting. To use it, we just define a variable on the AngularJS scope,
      and then place a reference to the scope in our HTML using th{{ }}  da-

      tabinding directives. In this case we set a variable callerepo on our
