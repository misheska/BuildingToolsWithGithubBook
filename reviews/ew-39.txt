   -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.html+json" | jq '.body_html'
   "<p>Hi, </p>\n\n<p>I have a problem with..."


   Without specifying an extra header, we get the internal representation of the
   data, sent as markdown.


   Note that if we don’t request the HTML representation, we don’t see it in the
   JSON by default.


   If we use a customized accept header like in the third instance, then our

   JSON is populated with a rendered version of the body in HTML.

   Besides “raw” and “html” there are two other format options that influence
how Markdown content is delivered via the GitHub API. If you specify “text” as a

format, the issue body would have been returned as plaintext. If you specify
“full” then the content will be rendered multiple times including the raw Mark-
down, rendered HTML, and rendered plaintext.

   In addition to controlling the format of text content, you can also retrieve
GitHub blobs either as raw binary or as a BASE64 encoded text. When retrieving

commits, you can also specify that the content be returned either as a diff or as
a patch. For more information about these fine-grained controls for formatting,

see the GitHub API documentation.


GitHub API Terms of Service


Before you start building a system atop another service’s API, it is always wise
to understand what, if any, limitations are placed on that API’s usage. Aside

from the limitations on bandwidth, GitHub’s API is also covered by the overall
GitHub Terms of Service. You can read these terms of service here: https://
help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service



GitHub Has Amazing API Documentation


The GitHub team has already provided very thorough documentation on their
API with examples using cURL. Bookmark this URL: https://develop-

er.github.com/v3/. You’ll use it often. Do note that this URL is tied, obviously, to
the current API “Version 3”, so this URL will change when a new version is re-

leased.
