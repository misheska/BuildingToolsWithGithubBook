CHAPTER 2: Introduction



                       Summary


                       In this chapter we learned how to access the GitHub API from the simplest cli-
                       ent available: the command line cURL HTTP tool. We also explored the API by
                       looking at the JSON and played with a command line tool (jq) that when paired

                       with cURL gives us the ability to quickly find information in the often large body
                       of data the GitHub API provides. We learned about the different authentication

                       schemes supported by GitHub, and also learned about the possibilities and
                       tradeoffs when accessing the GitHub API from within a browser context.
                          In the next chapter we will look at Gists and the Gist API. Weâ€™ll use Ruby to

                       build a Gist display program, and host all source files for the application as a
                       Gist itself.
