   You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changâ–¯es!
   To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.


   Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

   {% highlight ruby %}

   def print_hi(name)
     puts "Hi, #{name}"
   end
   print_hi('Tom')
   #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

   {% endhighlight %}
