                                                                               A Jekyll Blog in 15 Minutes


THE GH-PAGES BRANCH

To work on the gh-pages branch, check it out and create the branch inside your

repository.


   $ git checkout -b gh-pages
   $ rake post title="My next big blog post"
   $ git add _posts
   $ git commit -m "Added my next big blog post"
   $ git push -u origin gh-pages


   You will need to always remember to work on the gh-pages branch; if this
repository is only used as a blog, then this probably is not an issue. Adding the

-u switch will make sure that git always pushes up the gh-pages branch when-
ever you do a push.


THE CNAME FILE


The CNAME file is a simple text file with the domain name inside of it.


   $ echo 'mydomain.com' > CNAME
   $ git add CNAME
   $ git commit -m "Added CNAME"
   $ git push


   Once you have pushed the CNAME file to your repository, you can verify that
GitHub thinks the blog is established correctly by visiting the admin page of

your repository. An easy way to get there is using thegithub  gem, no longer
actively maintained but still a useful command line tool.


   $ gem install github
   $ github admin # Opens up https://github.com/username/repo/settings


   The github gem is a useful command line tool, but unfortunately it is tied to
an older version of the GitHub API, which means the documented functionality

is often incorrect.
   If your blog is correctly setup, you will see something like Figure 3 in the mid-

dle of your settings page.
