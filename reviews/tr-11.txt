help you get past this roadblock, whenever possible, this book shows you how

to write code which interacts with the GitHub API and is testable.


First Class Languages You Need to Know


There are two languages which are so fundamentally linked to GitHub that you

do need to install and use them in order to get the most out of this book.

    • Ruby: a simple, readable programming language used heavily by the
      founders of GitHub.

    • JavaScript: the only ubiquitous browser side programming language, its
      importance has grown to new heights with the introduction of NodeJS,

      rivaling even the popularity of Ruby on Rails as a server side toolkit for
      web applications, especially for independent developers.

   Your time will not be wasted if you install and play with these two tools. Be-

tween them you will have a solid toolset to begin exploration of the GitHub API.
Several chapters in this book use Ruby or JavaScript, so putting in some time to

learn at least a little bit will make the journey through this book richer for you.
   Undoubtedly, many of you picking up this book already have familiarity with

Ruby or JavaScript/NodeJS. So, the basics and installation of them are in ap-
pendices in the back of the book. The appendices don’t cover syntax of these
languages; we expect you have experience with other languages as a prerequi-

site and can read code from any imperative language regardless of the syntax.
Later chapters which do discuss a facet of the API go into language details at

times, and the code is readable regardless of your familiarity with that particu-
lar language. These explanatory appendices discuss the history of these tools

within the GitHub story as well as important usage notes like special files and
installation options.



Who This Book is Not For


If you are looking for a discussion of the GitHub API that focuses on a single lan-
guage, you will be disappointed to find that we look at the API through many
different languages. We do this to describe the API from not only the way the

GitHub team designed it to work, but the aspirational way that client library
authors made it work within diverse programming languages and communities.

We think there is a lot to learn from this approach, but if you are interested in
only a specific language and how it works with the GitHub API, this is not the

book for you.
