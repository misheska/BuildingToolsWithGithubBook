CHAPTER 10: CoffeScript, Hubot and the Activities API



 FIGURE 10-2













                           Slack supports many different service integrations, and one of them is Hu-
                        bot.

                           Choosing Hubot takes you to a settings screen for your Hubot integration.
                           Slack automatically generates an authentication token for you. This token is

                        used to verify the connection from your Hubot. This token can be revoked, and
                        in fact the token from the image below has been revoked and can no longer be

                        used to authenticate into Slack. If you ever accidentally publicize this token,
                        you can easily revoke and reassign a token to your Hubot on this screen.

                           You will also need to specify a name. Use “probot” and if you’d like, change
                        the avatar associated with the Hubot.
