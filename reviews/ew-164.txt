                            You are generally free to choose whatever settings you like. Google produces
                         a real device called the Nexus 5. This is the Android reference device, and is a

                         good option for a generic device with good support across all features. You can
                         choose this one if you are confused about which to use.

                            Once you have created an AVD, start it up. It will take a few minutes to boot;
                         AVDs emulate the chipset in software and booting up can take a few minutes,
                         unfortunately. There are alternative tools that speed up AVD boot time (Geny-

                         motion is one of those), but usage of these tools is are outside the scope of this
                         book. After your AVD has completed booting, you can test to see if it is correctly

                         started and available using the adb command line tool.
