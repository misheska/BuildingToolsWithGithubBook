                                                                                            The Code



            self.SetTitle('GitHub Issue Search')
            self.Show()


   The __init__   method is the constructor, so this is where we start when the
main function callsSearchFrame()   . Here’s what’s happening at a high level –

we’ll dig into the details in a bit:

   1. Set up some layout dimensions and pass to the parent class’s constructor

   2. Create the UI controls

   3. Retrieve the credentials from the user using the credential helper we de-
      scribed earlier

   4. Change the title and display the application to the user

   Before we get to how all those things are done, let’s step back a bit and talk
about this class’s job. It’s responsible for maintaining the top-level “frame” (a

window with a title bar, a menu, and so on), and deciding what’s displayed in
that frame. In this case, we want to show a login UI first, and when we get valid

credentials (either from Git or the user), we’ll switch to a searching UI.
   Alright, enough background. Let’s walk through the code for getting and

checking credentials.

       def login_accepted(self, username, password):

            self.credentials['username'] = username
            self.credentials['password'] = password
            if self.test_credentials():
                self.switch_to_search_panel()


       def test_credentials(self):
            if any(k not in self.credentials for k in ['username', 'password']):
                return False
            g = Github(self.credentials['username'], self.credentials['password'])

            status,data = g.user.orgs.get()
            if status != 200:
                print('bad credentials in store')
                return False
            self.orgs = [o['login'] for o in data]

            return True

       def switch_to_search_panel(self):
            self.login_panel.Destroy()
            self.search_panel = SearchPanel(self,

                                               orgs=self.orgs,
                                               credentials=self.credentials)
            self.sizer.Add(self.search_panel, 1, flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, border=10)
            self.sizer.Layout()
