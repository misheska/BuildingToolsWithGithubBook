CHAPTER 4: Gollum


                       have access to these variables, so our link needs to be relative, which works

                       when we are in history review, but not in the normal review. It does not affect
                       viewing the files so this would require educating your stakeholders on the limi-

                       tations of this link.


                       Summary


                       In this chapter we learned how to create a Gollum wiki from scratch, both on

                       GitHub and as a fresh repository from the comman line. We then looked at the
                       different ways to use thgollum  command line tool and learned why this is a
                       nice option when we want to run our own Gollum server. Finally, we built a cus-

                       tomized Gollum image-centric editor using the Rugged library for Ruby.
                          Our next chapter explores the GitHub API from what might be an unexpected

                       vantage point: JavaScript. In this chapter we will show you how to host an en-
                       tire application on GitHub, no server required, that still allows modification of
                       data inside of GitHub by its users.
