                                                                                       Prerequisites


   $ adb devices -l

   * daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
   * daemon started successfully *
   List of devices attached
   0222fdc60910aede         device usb:1D110000 product:hammerhead model:Nexus_5 device:hammerhead


   Running the adb command starts a daemon service which communicates
with your device. In this case the daemon reported that I have a single device
attached via USB which is the emulated Nexus 5 device.



Creating a New Project

   $ mkdir ghru # GitHub R U?

   $ cd ghru
   $ android create project --target 13 --name GHRU --path . --activity GitHubRu --package com.githubru

   These three commands create a new directory ghru , enter the directory, and

then build a simple Android directory structure with the proper files.
   If you have the ant tool installed, you can build this new project want the

debug  command. This will create an APK in the bin directory called ./bin/
Ghru-debug-unaligned.apk     . To install it on your device run the command

ant debug install    . Then, you can launch the application by double clicking
on the application titled “GitHubRu”.


ADDING GRADLE SUPPORT


Gradle is a new build system for Java and has become theoffical build system
for the Android platform. Using a simpbuild.gradle   file we can build an en-

tire Android application from the command line. Gradle is well supported with
more advanced editors, so you can always import an Android project using Gra-
dle and use it with editors like Eclipse or Android Studio. Ant used to be the de-

fault and preferred method of building Java projects from the command line,
but gradle syntax is so simple and powerful and lightweight that it is now the

preferred build system by the Android team.

   buildscript {

       repositories {
           mavenCentral()
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.6.+'
       }

   }
