CHAPTER 3: Gists and the Gist API


                         <b><%= f %></b>:

                         <%= h g[:files][f.to_sym].rels[:raw].get.data %>

                         <br/>

                         <br/>

                         <% end %>
                         <% end %>


                         </body>
                         </html>

                         Now we see the gists and the contents.

                      Summary


                      In this chapter we looked at gists and learned how they can be used to share

                      code snippets. We built a simple application and stored it as a gist. This appli-
                      cation retrieves data from the GitHub API using our first higher level language

                      client library (the Octokit library for Ruby). We also went deeper into how Hy-
                      permedia works and how a client library implements using Hypermedia meta-
                      data.

                         In the next chapter we will look at Gollum, the GitHub wiki. This chapter pro-
                      vides an introduction to the Rugged Ruby library for accessing Git repositories

                      and the Ruby library for accessing GitHub.
