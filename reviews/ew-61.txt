                                                                                Building a Gollum Editor


special interface which allows quickly editing and reviewing these files locally.
And all of it can be published into GitHub for review (though we won’t allow ed-

iting of the information there, since GitHub has its own editing modality.)
   Gollum is built on Ruby and uses the Grit library underneath. Using Ruby

makes sense because we can leverage the existing Grit and Gollum libraries.
We’ll also use Sinatra, the same web application library we used in the last

chapter.


     The gollumcommand is, in fact, a customized wrapper around Sinatra.


   This will be a dual purpose repository. We can use the repository with gol-
lum as a standard wiki. And, we can use it with our application to enter data in

a more powerful way than gollum permits from its default interface. The data
will still be compatible with gollum and will be hosted on GitHub.

   To begin, initialize our repository.


   $ mkdir images
   $ cd images
   $ git init .
   $ printf "### Our home" > Home.md
   $ git add Home.md

   $ git commit -m "Initial checking"

   We’ve just created a wiki compatible with gollum. Let’s see what it looks like

inside gollum. run the  gollum   command then open      http://localhost:
4567/  in your browser.
