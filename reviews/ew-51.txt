Wikis have revolutionized the way we create and digest information. It turns out
they are a great complement to technical projects (code repositories) because
they allow non-technical users to contribute information without disturbing de-

velopers. Gollum is GitHub’s open source version of a wiki. Just as Git has revo-
lutionized collaborative editing of code, Gollum wikis layer the benefits of Git
onto a proven publishing workflow. The true power of Gollum wikis reveal
themselves when you see how tightly integrated with GitHub they are. You can
quickly build and associate a wiki with any repository, and create a collabora-
tive documentation system around any repository hosted on GitHub. And, you
can pull in information from git repositories with ease, linking documentation

with live code.
  In this chapter we’ll explore the basics of using Gollum, creating a wiki on
GitHub and then understanding how to edit it on GitHub, and as a repostory on
our local machine. We will then create a Gollum wiki by hand from the com-
mand line, and show the bare minimum set of files to call something a Gollum
repository. Finally, we will build a simple image organization tool which allows
us to edit a Gollum wiki in an entirely different way, but still publishes informa-

tion into GitHub as a regular Gollum wiki, exploring a little bit of the internals of
Git along the way.


“The Story of Smeagol…”

Gollum wikis are simply an agreed upon file structure. At its most basic form, a
Gollum wiki is a git repository with aHome.ext(extwould be any of
the supported wiki markup formats, which we will talk about later).

  First, let’s learn how to create a gollum wiki from the GitHub interface, and
then later we’ll move into creating one from scratch as a git repository.
