     Android and the Git Data API                                 8








Android is currently the most popular operating system for mobile devices,
overtaking Symbian OS in 2010, experiencing incredible growth since its release
in 2008. If it is not the case already, mobile OSes like Android and iOS will soon
be more prevalent than desktop OSes. Though it may not occur to many people
yet, as more and more people shift to using mobile devices, we will see demand
for developer tools on mobile devices. The GitHub API has a good set of bind-

ings for developing Java and Android applications. We’ll use the egit libraries to
develop a small Android application which posts to our blog hosted on GitHub.
  Our blogging application will allow us to login to GitHub, and then ask us for
a quick note describing how we are feeling. The application will then compose
a Jekyll blog post for us and push the post into our blog on GitHub.


Prerequisites


Setting up a Jekyll blog

We are writing an application which adds jekyll blog entries, and we are writing
tests to verify our application works as advertisted, so we need a sandbox blog
against which we can run commands. There are various ways to create a new
Jekyll blog. The simplest is to run a series of Ruby commands documented
here; if you want to know more about Jekyll, it is covered in more depth in the
Jekyll chapter. There are a few items of note when establishing a Jekyll blog

that have some complexity, things like mapping a hostname properly and using
the correct branch inside git. For our purposes here, however, we won’t need to
make sure all that is established. All we need is to make sure that we have a
sandbox repository that has the structure of a jekyll blog.

  $ printf "source 'https://rubygems.org'\n\ngem 'github-pages'\ngem 'hub'" >> Gemfile
  $ export BLOG_NAME=mytestblog
  $ bundle
  $ jekyll new $BLOG_NAME
