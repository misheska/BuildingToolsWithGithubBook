                                          Introduction                     2









The GitHub API is extremely comprehensive, permitting access and modifica-
tion of almost all data and metadata stored or associated with a Git repository.
Here is a summary of those sections ordered alphabetically as they are on the
GitHub API documentation site (https://developer.github.com/v3/):

    • Activity: notifications of interesting events in your developer life

    • Gists: programmatically create and share code snippets
    • Git Data: raw access to Git data over a remote API
    • Issues: add and modify issues

    • Miscellaneous: whatever does not fit into the general API categorization
    •Organizations: access and retrieve organizational membership data

    •Pull Requests: a powerful API layer on the popular merge process
    •Repositories: modify everything and anything related to repositories

    •Search: code driven search within the entire GitHub database
    •Users: access user data

    •Enterprise: specifics about using the API when using the private corporate
     GitHub

   In addition, though not a part of the API, there are other important technolo-
gies you should know about when using GitHub which are not covered in the
API documentation:

    •Jekyll: hosting blogs and static documentation
    •Gollum: wikis tied to a repository

    •Hubot: a programmable chat robot used extensively at GitHub

   With just one or two exceptions, Each of these sections of the GitHub tech-
nology stack are covered in various chapters. The GitHub API documentation is
a stellar reference which you will use constantly when writing any application
that talks to the API, but the chapters in this book serve a different purpose:
