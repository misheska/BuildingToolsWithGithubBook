  JavaScript and the Git Data API                                     9









GitHub offers libraries which work within other programming languages and
frameworks, and more often than not, these tools run on a server. Runnig a
server means finding and managing a server, often an onerous and expensive
task. The GitHub API is accessible purely on the client side, however, if you use

the JavaScript client library. To demonstrate this library, we will build a single
page app, hosting everything on GitHub and using the GitHub API through a
pure JavaScript client-side library.
  JavaScript is the lingua franca of the web, invented in 1995 as a scripting
language embedded inside the first web browsers. JavaScript has recently

found its way to the server side as well with NodeJS, an innovative toolkit for
building high performance network servers. JavaScript is a useful language to
know, whether on the server side or strictly client side web development. There
is a separate GitHub API client for NodeJS which supports a different interface
and has different considerations because of browser sandbox security issues.

The client side JavaScript library is, in my humble opinion, a bit more ambi-
tious because it is effective on the browser, and it opens up some fun integra-
tions with Firebase as we will discuss later in the chapter.


    The main weakness of JavaScript has always been testability. Mainly due
    to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, writing tests has never been
    easy; polling for changes when a callback returns was until recently the
    best way to test nonlinear code. But, recent toolkits like AngularJS and
    promise-based libraries have made testing not only easy but elegant as
    well. Building applications on top of third party services makes testing
    even more important than it already was, and weâ€™ll make sure to add
    testing to our application to verify the functionality works as we expect.

  A single page application should fulfill a single simple purpose. It has to be

important and direct. It should help us do something important. Logically, this
application should help us find good coffee.
