                        GitHub API Rate Limits


                        GitHub tries to limit the rate at which users can make requests to the API.

                        Anonymous requests, requests that haven’t authenticated with either a user-
                        name/password or OAuth information, are limited to 60 requests an hour. If you

                        are developing a system to integrate with the GitHub API on behalf of users,
                        clearly 60 requests per hour isn’t going to be sufficient.

                           This rate limit is increased to 5000 requests per hour if you are making an
                        authenticated request to the GitHub API, and while this rate is two orders of

                        magnitude larger than the anonymous rate limit, it still presents problems if
                        you intend to use your own GitHub credentials when making requests on behalf

                        of many users.
                           For this reason, if your web site or service uses the GitHub API to request in-

                        formation from the GitHub API, you should consider using OAuth and make re-
                        quests to the GitHub API using your user’s shared authentication information.


                             There are actually two rate limits. The “core” rate limit and the “search”
                             rate limit. The rate limits explained in the previous paragraphs were for

                             the core rate limit. For search, requests are limited at 20 requests per mi-
                             nute for authenticated user requests and 5 request per minute for anony-
                             mous requests. The assumption here is that search is a more infrastruc-

                             ture intensive request to satisfy and that tighter limits are placed on its
                             usage.


                           Note that GitHub tracks anonymous requests by IP address. This means that

                        if you are behind a firewall with other users making anonymous requests, all
                        those requests will be grouped together.



                        Reading Your Rate Limits

                        Reading your rate limit is straightforward, just make a GET request to /

                        rate_limit. This will return a JSON document which tells you the limit you are
                        subject to, the number of requests you have remaining, and the timestamp (in

                        seconds since 1970). Note that this timestamp has a timezone in Coordinated
                        Universal Time (UTC).

                           The following command listing uses curl to retrieve the rate limit for an
                        anonymous request. This response is abbreviated to save space in this book,

                        but you’ll notice that the quota information is supplied twice: once in the HTTP
                        response headers and again in the JSON response. The rate limit headers are

                        returned with every request to the GitHub API, so there is little need to make a
                        direct call to the /rate_limit API.
