                                                                                                Introduction


      backed by a database called GitHub using the JavaScript language. Im-
      portanly, we show how you can write a testable JavaScript application

      that mocks out the GitHub API when needed.
    • The “Hubot” chapter: Hubot is a JavaScript (NodeJS) chat robot enabling

      technologists to go beyond developer operations (“DevOps”) to a new
      frontier called “ChatOps.” The Hubot chapter illustrates using the Activi-

      ties and Pull Requests section of the API. In addition we show how you
      can simulate GitHub notifications and how to write testable Hubot exten-

      sions (which is often a challenge when writing JavaScript code).

   We don’t cover the organization API: this is a small facet of the API with only
the ability to list organizations and modify metadata about your organization;

once you have used other parts of the API this nook of the API will be very intu-
itive.

   We also don’t cover the users section of the API. While you might expect it to
be an important part of the API, the users API is really nothing more than an
endpoint to list information about users, add or remove SSH keys, adjust email

addresses and modify your list of followers.
   There is not a specific chapter on issues. Historically GitHub used to group

issues and pull requests into the same API section, but with the growing impor-
tance of pull requests they have separated them in the API documentation. In

fact, they are still internally stored in the same database and pull requests are,
at least for now, just another type of issue. The Hubot chapter documents using

pull requests and is a good reference for issues in that way.
   The enterprise API works almost exactly the same as the GitHub.com site
API. We don’t have a chapter telling a story about the enterprise API, but we do

provide an appendix which provides a few notes about how to use it with a few
API client libraries.

   With these chapters we cover the entire API and hope to give you an inside
look into the inner workings of the brain of a developer building on top of the

GitHub API.
   As you might have noticed, this book will take you on an exploration of sev-
eral different language clients for the GitHub API. Along the way, we’ll point out

the different idioms and methodologies inherent to those client libraries and
shed light on the darker corners of the GitHub API. Don’t be alarmed if you

thumb through the chapters and see a language which you don’t know at all:
each chapter is designed so that you can follow along without intimacy to the

language or toolkit. You will get the most value if you install the language and
associated tools, but the story behind the projects we will build will be interest-

ing even if you don’t actually type a line of code from the chapter.
   Enough of the theoretical: let’s jump into using the API with the powerful
cURL tool.
