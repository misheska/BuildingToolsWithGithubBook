search all the issues in all the repositories in a single organization. It’ll end up

looking a bit like Figure 5-1.

User flow


That’s the overall goal, but let’s dig in to more detail about how the user experi-
ences the application.
   The first thing we’ll do is require the user to log in with GitHub credentials.

Why? Partly because the search API is throttled pretty aggressively, and the rate
limits are higher with authenticated access. But also because our user is going

to need the ability to search issues in private repositories. To make this easier,
our program will try to get GitHub credentials from Git’s credential store, but

it’ll fall back to a login form, which looks like Figure 5-2.
