CHAPTER 2: Introduction


                       cURL: a starting point for API exploration


                       There will be times when you want to quickly access information from the API

                       without writing a formal program. Or, when you want to quickly get access to
                       the raw HTTP request headers and content. Or, where you might even question

                       the implementation of a client library and need confirmation it is doing the
                       right thing from another vantage point. In these situations, cURL, a simple com-

                       mand line HTTP tool, is the perfect fit. cURL, like the best unix tools, is a small
                       program with a very specific and purposefully limited set of features for access-

                       ing HTTP servers.
                          cURL gives you the most naked vantage point you will find for the GitHub API

                       (barring using a network traffic analysis tool). cURL, like the HTTP protocol
                       which it speaks intimately, is stateless, meaning it is challenging to use cURL to

                       hit a service and then use the results with a secondary request. We will use
                       cURL in a later chapter within a shell script that explores solutions to this prob-

                       lem, but note that cURL works best with one-off requests.


                            INSTALLING CURL

                            If you are running these examples on a Linux box, you should be able use
                            your native package management tool to install cURL - either a “sudo

                            yum install curl*” on a RedHat variant or “sudo apt-get install curl” on
                            an Ubuntu (or Debian) system. If you are on any recent version of OSX,
                            you already have cURL installed, but it you can’t find it, take a look at the

                            HomeBrew project (http://brew.sh/) or MacPorts project (http://
                            www.macports.org/). If you are running on Windows or another operating
                            system, you best bet is to download cURL from the cURL web site here:
                            http://curl.haxx.se/download.html



                          Let’s make a request. We’ll start with the most basic GitHub API endpoint
                       found at https://api.github.com.


                          $ curl https://api.github.com
                          {

                             "current_user_url": "https://api.github.com/user",
                             "current_user_authorizations_html_url":
                             "https://github.com/settings/connections/applications{/client_id}",

                             "authorizations_url": "https://api.github.com/authorizations",
                             "code_search_url":
                             "https://api.github.com/search/code?q={query}{&page,per_page,sort,order}",
                             "emails_url": "https://api.github.com/user/emails",

                             "emojis_url": "https://api.github.com/emojis",
                             ...
                          }
