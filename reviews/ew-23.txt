   With the -v switch you get everything: DNS lookups, information on the SSL

chain, and the full request and response information.


     Be aware that if you print out headers, a tool like jq will get confused be-
     cause you are no longer providing it with pure JSON.


   This section shows us that there is interesting information not only in the

body (the JSON data) but also in the headers. It is important to understand
what headers are here and which ones are important. There are a lot of them
which the HTTP specification requires, and we can often ignore those, but there

are a few that are vital when you start making more than just a few isolated re-
quest.



All The Headers and Data


Three headers are present in every GitHub API response which tell you about

the GitHub API rate limits. They are X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining,
and X-RateLimit-Reset. These limits are explained in detail in “GitHub API Rate
Limits”.

   The X-GitHub-Media-Type header contains information that will come in
handy when you are starting to retrieve text or blob content from the API. when

you make a request to the GitHub API you can specify the format you want to
work with by sending an Accept header with your request.

   Let’s look at the full response from the original request.
