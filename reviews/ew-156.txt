CHAPTER 7: Ruby and Jekyll


                         <br/>
                         <em>Posted on {{ post.date | date_to_string }}</em>
                         <br/>

                         {% endfor %}
                         </div>


                         Note that in this case the variable is presentedpost.image   as compared
                      to page.image   when we are inside a post. Jekyll and Liquid are not consistent

                      here, so caveat emptor.
                         Our blog definitely has more life when we add in the original colors and im-
                      ages. It still looks like a blog from the last millenium, but it is an improvement.

                      MAPPING INTEGRATION

                      This is a site about travel information, so it makes sense to add maps as well.

                      We can process the location information we retrieved from the archived site
                      and add a map image.

                         Add a new function called process_location    and place it underneath the
                      process_creation_date      method inside theget_ith_page   method.
