                                                                Building a Coffee Shop Database on GitHub


   We alter our lat/lng information to point to a Google Maps page.


   Now if we type in the word gluten  in our search box, we filter out anything
except shops which match that, and we see the information pieces formatted
as labels underneath the shop name.




                                                                                 FIGURE 9-4
















ADDING DATA USING PULL REQUESTS


Now that we have a functioning application, let’s allow people to add informa-
tion themselves and help build our database. Just beneath the link to the map
link, add a button which will allow us to annotate affeeshop with extra infor-

mation.
   To add an annotation to our existing data we are going ask users to contrib-

ute the “GitHub” way. Users will fork the repository, make a change, and then
issue a pull-request. We can do all of this from our webapp using the Github.js

library. This requires that we ask the users to login, so we will prompt them for
their username and password, as well as the data they want to annotate.

   The implementation we will use starts with adding an “annotate” button to
our HTML.


   <button ng-click="annotate(shop)">Add factoid</button>

   Let’s add some tests. Add another file called         coffeetech.anno-

tate.spec.js   with these contents:


   describe( "GithubCtrl", function() {

       var scope = undefined, gh = undefined, repo = undefined, prompter = undefined;


       function generateMockPrompt() {
