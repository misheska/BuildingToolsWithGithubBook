- [ ] from page [24 ew](ew-24.txt): '"Displaying all of this is a bit daunting, it presents a wall of text that is of limited use to the reader. Reconsider if this is needed and how you might present it differently?"'
- [ ] from page [26 ew](ew-26.txt): '"The flow of the chapter feels a bit abrupt here... we have gone from curl headers to http authentication suddenly. \n\nIt feels like there needs to be more context:\n\nWhat are we trying to teach the user?

- [ ] from page [40 ew](ew-40.txt): '"This chapter feels like it bombards the reader with information. This maybe fine if this was simply a GitHub manual or reference book...\n\nOverall it is very hard to read and there is no context on how the reader might best use the tools discussed."'

- [ ] from page [84 ew](ew-84.txt): '"This is a terrible reason as it is superficial; covering lots of languages doesn't make for a better book. \n\nIn fact, an arbitrary tour of different programming languages as a tick box exercise just serves to confuse the reader and disrupt the flow of t\nhe book."'
- [ ] from page [84 ew](ew-84.txt): '"Python wasn't really mentioned in the introduction of the book. If we are insisting on building this app, why wasn't Ruby on Rails used? The reader was expected to know Ruby well after all?"'

- [ ] from page [98 ew](ew-98.txt): '"Justifications like this tend to indicate that things ARE that bad."'
- [ ] from page [98 ew](ew-98.txt): '"It begs the question why non technical users would be directly searching through GitHub? Surely they would be searching Google for solutions to their problems?

- [ ] from page [99 ew](ew-99.txt): '"This line has a few problems...\n\n1 - having slogged through Python, you are now telling the reader you want to completely change tact and go into DotNet... This plays back to what we discussed earlier about using too many languages.\n2 - such a standalo\nne and cold line right at the end of the chapter is very jarring. Leave out talking about the next chapter, the introduction to the next chapter can cover itself."'

- [ ] from page [114 ew](ew-114.txt): '"At this point you have thrown a lot of code at the reader and it is somewhat overwhelming"'
- [ ] from page [116 ew](ew-116.txt): '"It feels like a missed opportunity for us to have walked through a prepared example that allowed the reader to mess around with the commit status API without having to worry about all the extra boilerplate."'
- [ ] from page [116 ew](ew-116.txt): '"This sort of conclusion is worrying as it almost implies the author is trying to sell C# to the reader. None of this is relevant to GitHub, let alone the commit status API that this chapter is supposed to be about."'
