CHAPTER 10: CoffeScript, Hubot and the Activities API


                          This command runs the hubot script with the slack adapter. The slack adapt-
                       er knows how to interact with the Slack.com service. It requires an authentica-
                       tion token, and this is provided via the environment variable at the beginning of

                       the line.


                       A FIRST CONVERSATION

                       Your bot should be setup and waiting in the #general room inside your Slack

                       site. Go to the #general room. Then, you can test that probot is properly con-
                       nectd by typing in the name of your Hubot and then a command like       the

                       rules . For example, if our Hubot is namedprobot  , then we would type pro-
                       bot the rules   .

                          We see that our hubot printed out the rules it abides by (published originally
                       by Isaac Asimov in his “Runaround” short story in 1942).


                       EXPLORING THE HUBOT VOCABULARY


                       Hubot out of the box supports many commands. To get a list, type “help”.

                          The pug me  command is a favorite. Many people new to Hubot quickly get
                       sucked into spending hours looking at cute pictures of pugs. Beware!
