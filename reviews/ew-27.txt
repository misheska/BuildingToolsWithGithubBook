                                                                                         Authentication


you do need simple and quick access to the GitHub API (and you don’t use two
factor authentication) then HTTP basic authentication can help you in a small

subset of use cases.


oAuth


oAuth is an authentication mechanism where tokens are tied to functionality or
clients. In other words, you can specify what features of a service you want to

permit an oAuth token to carry with it, and you can issue multiple tokens and
tie those to specific clients: a cell phone app, a laptop, a smart watch, or even

an Internet of Things toaster. And, importantly, you can revoke tokens without
impacting other tokens.
   The main downside to oAuth tokens is that they introduce a level of com-

plexity that you may not be familiar with if you have only used HTTP Basic
which generally only requires an extra header to the HTTP request, or an extra

flag to a client tool like cURL.
   oAuth solves the problems described above by linking tokens to scopes

(specified subsets of functionality inside a webs service) and issuing as many
tokens as you need to multiple clients.


SCOPES: SPECIFIED ACTIONS TIED TO AUTHENTICATION TOKENS


When you generate an oAuth token, you specify the access rights you require.
Don’t be confused because we start with HTTP Basic to generate the oAuth to-

ken: once you have the token, you no longer need to use HTTP Basic in succes-
sive requests. If this token is properly issued, the oAuth token will have permis-
sions to read and write to public repositories owned by that user.


   $ curl -u username -d '{"scopes":["public_repo"]}' https://api.github.com/authorizations
   {

     "id": 1234567,
     "url": "https://api.github.com/authorizations/1234567",
     "app": {
       "name": "My app",

       "url": "https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/",
       "client_id": "00000000000000000000"
     },
     "token": "abcdef87654321
     ...

   }

   The JSON response, upon success, has a token you can extract and use for

applications that need access to the GitHub API.
