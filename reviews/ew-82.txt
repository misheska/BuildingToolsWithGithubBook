CHAPTER 5: Python and the Search API


                            "items": [

                              {
                                "login": "ben",
                                "id": 39902,
                                "avatar_url": "…",
                                "gravatar_id": "",
                                "url": "…",

                                "html_url": "…",
                                …
                                "score": 98.24275
                              },
                              {

                                "login": "bengottlieb",
                                "id": 53162,
                                "avatar_url": "…",
                                "gravatar_id": "",
                                "url": "…",

                                "html_url": "…",
                                …
                                "score": 35.834213
                              },
                            ]
                          }


                          The list of items in this case look like the results from a query users/

                       <name>  endpoint. Useful items here are the user’s avatavatar_url   ), several
                       links to other API endpoints repos_url  ,url ), and the type of result (user or

                       organization, itype ).


                       Our example application


                       Now that we know a bit about how this API behaves, let’s do something useful

                       with it.
                          Imagine your development team uses GitHub to store their Git repositories,
                       and that there are lots of little repositories for parts of the application that work

                       together at runtime. This kind of situation ends up being fairly difficult to work
                       with for your non-technical colleagues; if they want to report an issue, they

                       don’t know where to go, and they don’t know how to find issues that already
                       exist.
                          Search can make this possible, but doing a search across an entire organiza-

                       tion’s repositories involves using user:<organization>     operator, which is
                       obtusely named, and kind of scary for non-programmers.

                          The Search API can make this a bit easier. Let’s make a GUI application with
                       just a single search box, which makes it dead simple for a non-technical user to
