CHAPTER 8: Android and the Git Data API


                          repositories {
                              mavenCentral()
                          }


                          apply plugin: 'android'

                          android {
                              compileSdkVersion 19
                              buildToolsVersion "19.0.1"


                              sourceSets {
                                main {
                                  manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'

                                  java.srcDirs = ['src']
                                  resources.srcDirs = ['src']
                                  res.srcDirs = ['res']
                                  assets.srcDirs = ['assets']
                                }

                              }

                          }


                          dependencies {
                            compile 'org.eclipse.mylyn.github:org.eclipse.egit.github.core:2.1.5'
                          }


                          Gradle build files use some standard boilerplate which you can ignore here,
                       but there are two items which are worth noting.


                          Gradle was not designed for Android; it started as a generic java build tool.
                          We need to specify where the files to compile reside for an android project

                          using thesourceSets   variable.


                          We can install the egit library, our interface to the GitHub API from within
                          Java, using this simple declaration. Gradle will download the proper JAR
                          files from the Maven repository and build them into our application using

                          this dependency declaration.


                       INSTALLING GRADLE


                       To use gradle, you need to install it manually. Gradle does not come packaged
                       with the Java SDK nor with the Android SDK. There are various ways to install
                       gradle: either using a built in package manager, or downloading from the web-

                       site gradle.org. Gradle is in constant flux as new versions are released, and I
                       found the easiest way for me to install it was to download into a directory

                       called “bin” and unzip the files there. Then, I could specify exactly the version
