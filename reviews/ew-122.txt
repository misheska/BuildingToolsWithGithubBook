CHAPTER 7: Ruby and Jekyll


                        that embedded code could look like    system("rm -rf /")      . Liquid provides
                        many of the benefits of embedded programming templates, without the dan-

                        gers.
                           Lastly, your jekyll directory has a special file ca_config.yml   . This is the

                        jekyll configuration file. Peering into it, you’ll see it is very basic:

                           name: Your New Jekyll Site

                           markdown: redcarpet
                           pygments: true

                           We only have three lines to contend with and they are simple to understand:

                        the name of our site, the Markdown parser used by our jekyll command, and
                        whether to use pygments to do syntax highlighting.

                           To view this site locally run this command:


                           $ jekyll serve

                           This command builds the entirety of your jekyll directory, and then starts a

                        mini web server to serve the files up to you. If you then visihttp://local-
                        host:4000   in your web browser, you will see something the front page of your

                        site and a single blog post listed in the index.
