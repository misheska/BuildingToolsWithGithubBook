                                                                               “The Story of Smeagol…”


   ```ruby
   def hello
     puts "hello"
   end

   ```

   A more interesting way of embedding code inside a Gollum repository is to

use the file include syntax. Again, use a triple backtick, followed by the file type
and then a reference to the code snippet inside a GitHub repository. You’ll need
to include the branch as well.


   ```html:github:xrd/TeddyHyde/blob/master/Gemfile```


   This will pull the file on GitHub located inside the “TeddyHyde” repository
for user “xrd” on the master branch named “Gemfile” and publish it with syntax

hilighted into your wiki as if you had used this markup.

   ```ruby

   source 'https://rubygems.org'

   gem "nokogiri"
   gem "rspec"
   gem 'calabash-android', :git => 'git://github.com/calabash/calabash-android.git'

   ```

   Unfortunately, you cannot specify a specific SHA commit to retrieve mo-

ments in history within the git repository, but this is still a powerful way to ex-
pose a file inside a Gollum wiki. If you need to do that, the best way might be to

create a branch from a specific SHA commit, and then reference that branch
when including the file.


   $ git checkout 0be3e4475db2697b8
   $ git checkout -b at_sha_0be3e4475db2697b8
   $ echo "gem 'rails' # Adding rails to Gemfile" >> Gemfile
   $ git commit -m "Added rails to Gemfile" -a

   $ git push origin at_sha_0be3e4475db2697b8

   This would generate a new branch based on an older commit, and push up

the branch. Then, you could reference this inside your wiki with the following
include


   ```html:github:xrd/TeddyHyde/blob/at_sha_0be3e4475db2697b8/Gemfile```

   Note that we’ve referenced the branch named after the specific SHA hash we

want.
