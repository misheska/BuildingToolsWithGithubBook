  <p>The animal on the cover of <em>Building Tools with GitHub</em> is a Beagle, a small- to medium-sized breed of dog. The modern beagle breed was developed in Great Britain in the 1830s, and was originally created to track small game animals, such as rabbits. Hunting using beagles to track prey is known as "beagling."</p>
 <p>Beagles are part of the hound family of dog breeds, but compared to other hounds, beagles are small, with shorter legs and snout. Beagles are most commonly tricolored (white, black, and brown), but can occasionally be found with only two of the three colors.</p>
