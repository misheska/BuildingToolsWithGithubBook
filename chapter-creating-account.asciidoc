== Creating a Github Account

It seems odd to have a whole chapter for this, but I'm assuming that
this will be an 8 page chapter.

==== Types of Github Plans

Table Figure: Compare the Features of Each Plan

===== Free

It costs nothing to sign-up for a Github account.

===== Personal

Once you start creating private repositories, you'll need a personal plan.

===== Organization

If you need to share private projects with more than X people, you'll
need an organization pan.

==== Choosing the Right Plan

Figure: A Decision Tree for What Plan to Choose

===== Open Source Development

If you are only contributing to open source projects, you can probably
get by with a Free plan.

===== Small Project Development

Small teams of less than 10 people working as individuals are best
served by personal plans.

===== Startups, Small to Medium Businesses

Once a company starts to depend on Github for coding and collaboration
it will make sense to use an Organziation plan.

===== Enterprise-scale Development

If you have hundreds or thousands of developers, you may not want to
use either of these plans.  In these situations, Github offers a
service called Github Enterprise.

==== SSH vs HTTPS

There are two transport options for loading code from GitHub: SSH and HTTPS.

Actually, at the time of this writing there are really three protocols: SSH, 
HTTPS and Subversion. Subversion is there for backwards compatibility with older 
workflows, and actually just maps the SVN protocol on top of Git. The only reason
you would use Subversion with GitHub is that you work in an organization that
requires use of Subversion but also wants to host their code on GitHub. If you work
for such an schizophrenic organization, you might want to start looking for another job right 
away.

Both HTTPS and SSH operate over a secure encrypted channel, but beyond this commonality 
there are very different reasons for using each.

Of the two, SSH is the best option. Whenever you can, use SSH.

===== HTTPS

The only reason you might prefer HTTPS is that this protocol can be useful if you are
inside a very restrictive firewall.
HTTPS traffic is almost always permitted (port 443 is a common "secure" port on almost 
any firewall). If you use HTTPS, the "git clone" command will use a URL which starts 
with https://. For example, to load the Ruby on Rails repository from GitHub you would 
use the command "git clone https://github.com/rails/rails.git".

===== HTTPS Downsides

When you use the HTTPS protocol, note that you will need to enter in
your password to authenticate. The command line git client (which might be what your
editor is using underneath the graphical interface you use to code) does not
have an ability to cache this password. This means each time you push code, or pull 
the latest changes, you will need to re-enter your password. Git is a protocol which 
supports making lots of little changes, so a requirement that you must add another ten 
seconds to your workflow makes HTTPS quickly unusable. GitHub has released a Ruby gem called "hub"
which you can alias so that you actually use the ruby gem client instead of the native 
command line client; this ruby gem client can cache and use HTTPS passwords. But, this requires
additional setup, convolutes your workflow, and SSH still offers more benefits. 

HTTPS is also a less efficient protocol for transferring files; cloning and interacting with 
repositories using HTTPS is slower for you. 

The only real benefit for HTTPS is for server administrators: it 
is easier to configure a server to provide HTTPS to git repositories than it is to provide those
repositories over SSH. GitHub is doing the work of hosting your git repositories for you, however, so this is not a compelling reason to consider HTTPS.

===== SSH 

SSH offers the same level of security but is much more convenient, more flexible and 
keeps access more secure. You will notice that GitHub offers SSH as the default protocol.

At the center of SSH is a concept called asymmetric cryptography also called 
public key cryptography. To use SSH you generate a public/private keypair. Then, you 
upload the public key into GitHub. You keep the private key on your machine, and 
you keep it private (meaning, don't send it over email, or post it on Facebook).

===== A brief tutorial on using SSH keys

If using SSH sounds complicated, don't fret. To generate a public/private keypair, 
you just need to run this command from a terminal:

[source,bash]
$ ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/xrdawson/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 

This generates two files, a file called ~/.ssh/id_rsa and another called ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. 
The first file is the private file and the second (ending with a suffix abbreviation of the word "public") is the public file. 

You will be asked if you want to enter a passphrase which protects usage of your keypair. If
you believe your machine is secure (for example, this is a laptop which uses fingerprint 
recognition to unlock the screen), then you can hit enter and not protect your private key
with a passphrase. If the key is sitting in a less secure position, such as a server on the 
Internet, then you might want to protect the key with a passphrase. If you lose the passphrase, 
you cannot use the key. However, replacing a key is an easy problem to rectify.

===== Putting your SSH public key on GitHub 

To store an SSH public key on GitHub, copy the key contents into your clipboard. On an OSX machine, you 
could use this command:

[source,bash]
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDG56LecqP2ip/odHzAkM3F/TyL5TjS0m6bNEo3p+m7KEU/eJ+ZvrF1/4ALPk59+Ca2NtOwewVs1RZNuV9BuMesTHFAxev6Zx4R56fwL45UuDm1gjpwevxwHe8aS0elek94OcgxYomnnnmB4Og/OIbVYICfaQ4VhE+xVVOF/TXIGkndZG/wBLFg9QwPTQKhOIgVDoTzdj0FZ9qXfhvc7AhGkeOAO+dyeNgfk8ghzRPqyztd14tq6gOVPAMce3mGQsugbcKxgRBbd/7VaWT5hQl5YVtLlcAvM1gHgvU8MNVhrJTKzZxlTNBVBnYy1QxPtB3LF25YL7jAjtMYkuEjmZff xrdawson@Chriss-MacBook-Pro-2.local

Select everything from the "ssh-rsa" to and including the "xrdawson@Chriss-MacBook-Pro-2.local" (which is the name of my MacBook Pro) and then copy it to your clipboard. Then, go to GitHub, click on the "Account Settings" button:

image::images/account-settings.png[]

Then, click on the "SSH" item in the navigation bar on the left. You'll see a list of SSH keys already in the system. You might not have any if you just setup your account. In my account, I have many SSH keys.

image::images/ssh-keylist.png[]

As you can see, I have a key for my OSX Laptop. I have another key for an Ubuntu server I manage, a server which has a user which has access to my repositories. Then, I have another server, this time running on Amazon Web Services, which also has access to my repositories. I have an Android device which has access, as well as a Chromebook running developer mode that has access to my GitHub repositories. Finally, I have a virtual machine (using Vagrant) on my OSX laptop, and this machine has its own access. 

To add your key, click on the "Add SSH Key" button at the very top right of the list of SSH keys. This action will open a form underneath into which you can choose a title for the SSH key and then the contents which you copied to the clipboard. Once the form looks something like this you can click the "Add Key" button.

===== The big reason why SSH trumps HTTPS

If you takeaway one thing about why SSH is better than HTTPS, let it be this: both HTTPS and SSH make
it easy to add access to your repositories. However, HTTPS makes it really hard to revoke that
access.

With HTTPS managing and securing access to your repository becomes *your* problem. With SSH, 
secure access is *GitHub's* problem. And, they've been thinking about the right ways to do this: 
from requiring re-entry of your password whenever a new SSH public key is added, 
to 2 factor authentication (utilizing email and your cell phone to verify your identity), GitHub has spent lots of time and money making sure your source code is protected from rogue access.
