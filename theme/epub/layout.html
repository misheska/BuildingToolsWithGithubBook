  <meta name="description" content="Most software developers use GitHub every day, for their work projects and for their personal projects. What makes GitHub so beloved is their approach to developer tools: they are simple and powerful, an extremely rare combination. GitHub tools begin with the GitHub.com web site, and extend to a programmable API and other user friendly desktop, open source projects, and command line tools. This book turns you into a virtual GitHub employee and shows how you can take this unique ecosystem and fashion your own tools to customize the GitHub workflow. We explore how to take the API and other open source tools like Jekyll (site builder), Hubot (chat robot) or Gollum (wiki) to expand developer productivity. We show you how to build extensible tools for the long term with automated test coverage, a must for API driven tools. And, we showcase a variety of languages and how they integrate with the GitHub ecosystem. If you or your team use GitHub, use this book to shape GitHub to your unique development needs"/>
